[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!Chandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?(They all stare, bemused.)Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.[Time Lapse]Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.Joey: Instead of...?Chandler: That's right.Joey: Never had that dream.Phoebe: No.Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me![Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]Ross: (mortified) Hi.Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...Chandler: Cookie?Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.Joey: Ohh.Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.Ross: Thanks.Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?Phoebe: Fine!  Be murky!Ross: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.Monica: No you don't.Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?Ross: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?Ross: Sorry.Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?(Ross gestures his consent.)Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)Monica: Rachel?!Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?Rachel: Hi, sure!Ross: Hi.(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens.  He sits back down defeated again.  A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.Chandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)Phoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.Joey: I say push her down the stairs.Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!![Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...Rachel: I'm all better now.Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.Paul: (over the intercom) It's, uh, it's Paul.Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!Joey: Who's Paul?Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?Ross: He finally asked you out?Monica: Yes!Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?Ross: (choked voice) That'd be good...Monica: (horrified) Really?Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!Phoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...Ross: A wandering?Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.(Monica goes to change.)Joey:  Hey, Paul!Paul: Yeah?Joey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.Monica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.Ross: Okay, sure.Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.Commercial Break[Scene: The Subway, Phoebe is singing for change.]Phoebe: (singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh![Scene: Ross's Apartment, the guys are there assembling furniture.]Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling the bookcase.)Joey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.Joey: (picking up a leftover part) What's this?Chandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.Joey: Which goes where?Chandler: I have no idea.(Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a plant.)Joey: Done with the bookcase!Chandler: All finished!Ross: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.Chandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?Ross: You guys.Chandler: Oh, God.Joey: You got screwed.Chandler: Oh my God![Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating.]Monica: Oh my God!Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?Monica: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?Paul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-Monica: -leg?Paul: (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.Monica: That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)[Scene: Ross's Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture.]Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!Joey: Shut up!Chandler: You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)Ross: That only took me an hour.Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?Paul: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?Paul: Isn't there?Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?Paul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually.Monica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...Paul: It's okay...Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?Paul: Two years.Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?Monica: (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne Loves Chaci.]Priest on TV: We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference![Scene: Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and talking.]Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?Joey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)Chandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.Joey: Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)Ross: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)[Cut to Rachel staring out of her window.]Commercial Break[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for Joey and Chandler.]Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.Chandler: That is amazing.Joey: Congratulations.Rachel: Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...Monica: (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.All: Morning. Good morning.Paul: (entering from Monica's room) Morning.Joey: Morning, Paul.Rachel: Hello, Paul.Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?(Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice so the others can't hear.  The others move Monica's table closer to the door so that they can.)Paul: Thank you!  Thank you so much!Monica: Stop!Paul: No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.Monica: We'll talk later.Paul: Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.All: Okayyy! (They do so.)Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor.Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?Joey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.Joey: Look, it was a job all right?Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."Joey: You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?Rachel: Oh, yeah.Monica: Well, it's like that. With feelings.Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.Monica: Big time!Rachel: Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.Rachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!Monica: What for?Rachel: I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.(Monica exits.)[Scene: Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.]Frannie: Hey, Monica!Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?Frannie: You had sex, didn't you?Monica: How do you do that?Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?Monica: You know Paul?Frannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?Frannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]Joey: (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?Joey: (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!(Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.)Rachel: Guess what?Ross: You got a job?Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!Monica: How'd you pay for them?Rachel: Uh, credit card.Monica: And who pays for that?Rachel: Um... my... father.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table.   Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]Rachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.Monica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.Phoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.Rachel: Thank you.Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.(Pause)Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...Monica: All right, you ready?Rachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!Monica: You can, I know you can!Rachel: I don't think so.Ross: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)Rachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.(She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it![Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by playing the national anthem.]Monica: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?Ross: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.Monica: You be okay?Ross: Yeah.Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?Monica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.(Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)Ross: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-Rachel: Sorry-Ross: No no no, go-Rachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-Ross: Split it?Rachel: Okay.Ross: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.Rachel: I knew.Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.Rachel: I did.Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?Rachel: Yeah, maybe...Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will...Rachel: Goodnight.Ross: Goodnight.(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.)Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?Ross: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)Closing Credits[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]Joey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.Phoebe: (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...Monica: What? I-I said you had a-Phoebe: (sings) What I said you had...Monica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop?Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?All: Yes!Monica: I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.Joey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.Ross: There's an image.Rachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?Rachel: I'm just serving it.All: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.Chandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)Customer: (To Rachel) Ahh, miss?   More coffee?Rachel: Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.Chandler: Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-[Scene Central Perk, everyone's there.]Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?Phoebe: Oh, yeah!Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.Monica: Absolutely.Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?Opening Credits[Scene: Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.]Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?Marsha: Well, she has issues.Ross: Does she.Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?(Carol, Ross's ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.)Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No.Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.(Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.)Ross:Hi.Carol: So.Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.Carol: Sorry. You look good too.Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...Carol: A lesbian?Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol?Carol: I'm pregnant.Ross: Pregnant?![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching Three's Company.]Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!Monica: What?Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!All: Eeaagh!(Rachel enters from her room.)Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.Rachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that!Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...Chandler: ...Dinah?Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...Monica: You didn't.Rachel: Oh, I am sorry...Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.Chandler: Boys? We're going in.(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there's a knock on the door which Monica answers.)Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi.Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.Ross: Carol's pregnant.Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her.Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'?Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.Rachel: So what are you gonna do?Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?[Scene, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their parents.]Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?Monica: Curry.Mrs. Geller: Mmmm!Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.Mr. Geller: (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.Ross: Aw, Mom...Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]Mrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.Mr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...Monica: What's that supposed to mean?Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.Monica: No it's not.Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...[Time Lapse.]Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.[Time Lapse.]Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.(Stunned silence ensues.)Mrs. Geller: (To Monica) And you knew about this?!Commercial Break[Scene: Central Park, everyone's there.]Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.)Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.Rachel: You're twins?Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.Chandler: What does she do?Phoebe: She's a waitress.Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.Rachel: The lights, please..(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up.  Ross enters from the bathroom.)Ross: ...How long was I in there?Rachel: I'm just cleaning up.Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?Rachel: Oh.. a little..Ross: Mm-hmm..Rachel: A lot.Ross: Mm.Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?Ross: Got me.Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together?Ross: Yeah.Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?Ross: Yes, yes!Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.]Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.(Susan enters holding a drink.)Susan: Hi.Carol: Ross, you remember Susan.Ross: How could I forget?Susan: Ross.Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?Carol: Dr. Oberman.Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-Susan: She.Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive.Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh. Carol: Thanks.Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..Carol: Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)[Scene Barry's office, Barry is working on patient, Robbie, as Rachel enters.]Rachel: Barry?Barry: C'mon in.Rachel: (hesitates) Are you sure?Barry: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.Robbie: Huh?!Barry: So, how ya doin?Rachel: I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!Barry: Yeah, well..Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.Barry: (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.(As Barry exits Robbie stares at Rachel.)Rachel: I dumped him.Robbie: Okay.[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're talking about how this is going to work.]Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?Carol: Give me a 'for instance'.Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?Carol: Marlon-Ross: Marlon?!Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.Ross: ...As in Mouse?Carol: As in my grandmother.Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?Carol: Julia..Susan: We agreed on Minnie.Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?[Scene: Barry's office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry's lamp as Barry enters.]Barry: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?Rachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.Barry: Oh, that's great.Rachel: Why are- why are you so tanned?Barry: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.Rachel: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?Barry: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.Robbie: Me?!Barry: No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.Rachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!Barry: Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.Rachel: Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!Barry: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.Rachel: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!Barry: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.Rachel: Okay..Barry: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.Rachel: Wow.Barry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.Rachel: What?Robbie: Me. (Spits.)Rachel: Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.Barry: Well, thank you for giving it back.(Barry and Rachel look at each other.)Robbie: Hello?![Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're still arguing about what to name the baby.]Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so.Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.Ross: Thank you!Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller.Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?Susan: It's my baby too.Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!Carol: All right, you two, stop it!Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-Dr. Oberman: (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?All: Yeah. Yeah. A little.Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.(He turns to go, but the sound of the sonogram catches hes ear.  He returns and stares at it.)Ross: Oh my God.Susan: Look at that.Carol: I know.Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram.   Rachel is on the phone.]Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing?Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here?Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.Ross: Then don't do that, alright?Phoebe: Okay!Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm.Ross: Wh- are you welling up?Monica: No.Ross: You are, you're welling up.Monica: Am not!Ross: You're gonna be an aunt.Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!Rachel: (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]Phoebe: (entering) Hi guys!All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'All: Ohh. Ouch.Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.Rachel: Since when?Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.Phoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.Rachel: And everybody knows this?Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow.Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.Monica: Uh, Ross.Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!Opening Credits[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a part.]Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"Joey: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."Chandler: Hey, that was really good!Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going.Chandler: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"Joey: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."Chandler: "Smoke away."(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  He fumbles and drops the lighter.  Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.Joey: What?Chandler: Relax your hand!(Joey lets his wrist go limp.)Chandler: Not so much!Joey: Whoah!Chandler: Hey!Joey: Hey!Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff.(Joey tries and visibly winces.)Chandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.Chandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)Chandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.Joey: Y'miss it?Chandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)[Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.]Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.(The guys stretch out their fingers.)Joey: That's ridiculous!Ross: Can I use.. either thumb?Rachel: (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!All: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.Rachel: (leaving to serve others) Good for me!(The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters.  She sits down without saying hi.)Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe?Phoebe: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.Monica: What did they do to you?Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-Ross: Easy.Phoebe: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!Phoebe: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!Phoebe: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...Monica: We're with you. We got it.(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)Phoebe: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing?Monica: (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)All: Oh! Oh, God!Ross: What is this?!Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!Chandler: And this- is my reward!Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit!All: Ohhh! Put it out!Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.Rachel: This Alan again? How's it goin'?Monica: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy?Monica: Let's see, today's Monday... Never.All: Oh, come on! Come on!Monica: No. Not after what happened with Steve.Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.Rachel: Well, then can we meet him?Monica: Nope. Schhorry.[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.Paula: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.Paula: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]Joey: Let it go, Ross.Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.Monica: Do you all promise?All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!Monica: (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?(Chandler makes a 'Cross my heart' sign.  It starts to rain and he taps on the window.)Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!(Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)Ross: Hey, Pheebs.Phoebe: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!Rachel: What bank is this?(The intercom buzzes.)Monica: Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?Alan: (on the intercom) It's Alan.Joey: (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!(Chandler comes in, dripping wet.)Monica: (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.(She opens the door and Alan enters.)Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.Alan: Hi.All: Hi, Alan.Alan: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!(Everyone laughs.)[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?(Silence.)Monica: C'mon!Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.All: Loved him! Yeah! He's great!Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?All: Yeah!Rachel: And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)The Guys: (reluctantly) Yeah.Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!Ross: ...What shoe?Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'(Dubious pause.)Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.Monica: Really!Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)Ross: You know what I like most about him, though?All: What?Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself.All: Yeah...Commercial Break[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter dejectedly in softball gear.]Monica: Hi.. how was the game?Ross: Well..All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?Joey: Alan.Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..Ross: What?Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?Rachel: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.[Scene: A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.]Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie.Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl.Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup.Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)Lizzie: Saltines?Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?Lizzie: What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's really money in here.Phoebe: I know.Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing?Phoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.Lizzie: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.Phoebe: Oh, that's fine, no.Lizzie: Would you like my tin-foil hat?Phoebe: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.Lizzie: Please, let me do something.Phoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?Lizzie: Okay.Phoebe: Okay.[Scene: Chandler's office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.   While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a squirt of air freshener and gags.][Scene: A Street, Phoebe and Lizzie are at a hot dog vendor.]Lizzie: Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?Phoebe: No, I'm fine.Lizzie: (leaves) See ya.(Phoebe opens the can and reacts.)Phoebe: Huh![Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]Ross: A thumb?!(Phoebe nods.)All: Eww!Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see?All: Nooo!(Chandler lights a cigarette.)All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!Rachel: It's worse than the thumb!Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair!Monica: Oh, why is it unfair?Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?(An awkward silence ensues.)Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it.Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?(Phoebe spits out her hair.)Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.Joey: Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?(Monica laughs and snorts.)Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.Rachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.(They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.]Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?Paula: No.Monica: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.Paula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!Monica: I know.. it's gonna be really hard.Paula: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.[Scene: Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]Joey: Do you have any respect for your body?Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.Rachel: (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.Chandler: Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)Rachel: (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good.Ross: If only he were a woman.Rachel: Yeah.(They give each other a dubious look.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyond except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.]Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)Monica: (entering) Hey.

What what what! ...Hi.Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.Monica: What's going on with you?Phoebe: I got no sleep last night!Ross: Why?Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!Monica: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.Phoebe: Thanks.(Chandler and Joey enter.

Let's talk reality for a second.Rachel: Okay.Joanne: When are you coming home?Rachel: What? Guys, I'm not.Joanne: C'mon, this is us.Rachel: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-Kiki: Waitressing?Rachel: Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.Leslie: Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are in pajamas and Monica is making something in the blender as Rachel enters.]Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)Rachel: What's that?Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and-Rachel: Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink.)Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!Monica: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want.Monica: (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks!Monica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?Monica: (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?Rachel: Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister![Scene: Madison Square Garden, the guys are trying to find their seats.]Ross: (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?Ross: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...Joey: C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, they're all hanging out in the living room.]Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?Phoebe: You are just like Jack.Rachel: ...Jack from downstairs?Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.Monica: Ah, the other Jack.Phoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..Rachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-Phoebe: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.Rachel: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...Phoebe: Floopy?Rachel: Yeah.Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word.Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?Monica: ...Pheebs?Phoebe: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.Rachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?[Scene: Madison Square Garden, the guys are watching the game.]Ross: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS!

Well, I'm not completely satisfied.Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)Receptionist: (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.)Ross: (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.Receptionist: Well, you'll have to wait your turn.Joey: Well, how long do you think it'll be?Receptionist: (sarcastic) Any minute now.Ross: Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy...[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the slumber party continues.]Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)Pizza Guy: (yelling from outside) Pizza guy!Rachel: Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the door.)Monica: Phoebe?Phoebe: What?Monica: Do you have a plan?Phoebe: I don't even have a 'pl'.Pizza Guy: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?Rachel: (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.Pizza Guy: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!Monica: (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'Pizza Guy: Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!Monica: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?Pizza Guy: Yeah, that sounds about right.Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?Phoebe: And-and a power tie?Pizza Guy: No, pretty much just a towel.Monica: (staggered) Oh God.Pizza Guy: So you guys want me to take this back?Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)Rachel: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?Phoebe: Big Bird's friend.Monica: I see pizza!Phoebe: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars.)Rachel: Hello?

Oh, I love him!Phoebe: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.Monica: Please tell me it's his mother.Phoebe: Definitely not his mother.Monica: Oh, no...Phoebe: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)[Scene: The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks kitting foreheads.  Chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist again.]Chandler: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all out on the balcony.]Monica: Light still out?Rachel: Yeah.Monica: Oh.

I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.[Scene: The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol.]Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?Joey: He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated...Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...Chandler: Then what?Ross: My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)Joey: What?Ross: It was my first time.Joey: With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the balcony.]Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?Phoebe: Uh-huh.Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine.

Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...Joey: Really?Chandler: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)Both: Hey, buddy.Ross: Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)Receptionist: (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?Joey: Oh, ah- the kid has it.Ross: The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.Kid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)Chandler: You gotta do it, man.Ross: (to the kid) Oh yeah?

(They start to fight over it.)Receptionist: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!Ross: (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)Ross: ...Now that was fun.Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing twister.]Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.Monica: Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.(There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and silently hands back the cushion.)Chandler: Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)(The phone rings and Chandler answers it.)Chandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.Rachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?Chandler: Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.Rachel: Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.Ross: Green. To the green.Rachel: (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)Rachel: (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.[Scene: Central Perk, all six are there.]Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.Phoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.(Long pause.)Ross: Multiple orgasms!Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, all are there.]Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!Joey: No plans, huh?Chandler: Not a one.Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up.Monica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.Phoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.Ross: Tony?Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?Phoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.Rachel: (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.Phoebe: (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?Rachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.Ross: That guy, he burns me up.Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".Phoebe: (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)Angela: Hi, Joey.Joey: My god, Angela.(Angela takes a seat at the counter.)Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.Angela: (casually) Joey.Joey: You look good.Angela: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.Joey: You don't say.(Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.)Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?Rachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?Rachel: Who?Ross: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?Rachel: Sure.(Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)Angela: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?Angela: Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...Joey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.Angela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?Joey: What?Angela: We're just friends.Joey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?Angela: What four of us?Joey: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself.]Joey: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.Monica: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.Joey: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...Monica: (looking out window) Oh, god help us.Joey: What?Monica: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!Joey: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.Monica: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.Joey: (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?[Scene: Ross' apartment, Chandler is over.]Ross: (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?Ross: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.Ross: Nuh-uh.Chandler: Yuh-huh.Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?Ross: (sheepish) No.Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?Ross: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.Chandler: There you go.[Scene: A fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?Joey: Yep.Monica: Which?Joey: Which what?Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?Joey: No, but he's...Monica: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...(Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking.)Angela: Hey, Joey.Monica: ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their significant others.]Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?Phoebe: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.Phoebe: Eww, I don't wanna do that.(Janice and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.)Chandler: Here we go.Phoebe: Ok, have a good break-up.Chandler: Hey, Janice.Janice: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?Janice: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...(Chandler sees Phoebe breaking up with Tony. She talks to him for a few seconds, hugs him, and then he leaves. Chandler is amazed how easy it was for her.)Chandler: What?Janice: What?Chandler: (covering) What... did you get me there?Janice: I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)Chandler: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.Janice: Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.Chandler: That's great.(The drinks arrive, and Chandler downs his espresso in one gulp.)Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?Janice: (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.(Chandler walks over to the counter where Phoebe is, and is asking her about the break-up.)Chandler: That's it?Phoebe: Yeah, it was really hard.Chandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.Phoebe: Ok, you weren't there.[Scene: The Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]Woman: Comin' through. Move, move.Rachel: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.Woman: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.Rachel: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.Woman: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.Rachel: What?Woman: No suds, no save. Ok?(Ross arrives.)Ross: What's goin' on?Rachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.Ross: Was your basket on top?Rachel: Yeah, but, there were no suds.Ross: So?Rachel: Well, you know, no suds, no save.Ross: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine.Woman: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.Ross: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.(The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff out of the machine and leaves.)Ross: (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.Rachel: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.Ross: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.(Ross pulls out a huge box of laundry detergent.)Rachel: What's that?Ross: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.(Rachel starts to load her clothes.)Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?Rachel: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?Rachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.Ross: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.Rachel: (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?Ross: (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table.]Monica: (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?Angela: Brooklyn Heights.Bob: Cleveland.Monica: How, how did that happen?Joey: Oh my god.Monica: What?Joey: I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.Commercial Break[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking.]Joey: So, you and Angela, huh?Bob: Yep. Pretty much.Joey: You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.Bob: Huh, I never really noticed.Joey: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.Bob: Monica, Monica is great.Joey: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.[Scene: The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking.]Monica: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.Angela: Yeah, isn't he?Monica: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.Angela: You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.Monica: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.Angela: Huh. That's nice.[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice.]Phoebe: Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.(Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.)Chandler: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.Janice: All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.[Scene: The laundromat.]Rachel: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.Ross: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.Rachel: What uh-oh?Ross: (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.Rachel: Ross, what's the matter?Ross: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.Rachel: Come on, show me.Ross: All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.Rachel: Oh, everything's pink.Ross: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.Rachel: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!(The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and laughs.)[Scene: The fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt, and Monica is very uncomfortable.]Monica: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?(Her and Joey walk away from the table.)Monica: Oh my god.Joey: What?Monica: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.Joey: Come on, they're close.Monica: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.Joey: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?Joey: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...Monica: Oh my god, what were you thinking?Joey: All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.Monica: (hits him lightly) Oh!Joey: Ow!Monica: (leaving) I'm outta here.Joey: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.Monica: Really?Joey: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.[Time lapse, Monica accidentally spilled her drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off. Joey is making eyes at Angela.]Monica: I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.(Angela is eating chicken wings and making the weasel-like noise Joey had told Bob about.)Joey: Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is still trying to ease things over with Janice, and there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]Chandler: Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.Janice: Ow!Chandler: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?Janice: Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.(She leaves.)Chandler: (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.Phoebe: Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?Chandler: Oh, I don't know, a million?Phoebe: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.Chandler: I'm fine.Phoebe: All right.(Janice returns from the bathroom.)Chandler: I'm not fine. Here she comes.Phoebe: Wait here. Breathe.(Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few seconds, and then Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to Chandler, and leaves.)Chandler: How do you do that?Phoebe: It's like a gift.Chandler: We should always always break up together.Phoebe: Oh, I'd like that.[Scene: The Launderama. Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]Ross: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.Rachel: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.(The same woman walks over and takes Rachel's laundry cart.)Rachel: Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.Woman: Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.(Rachel looks at Ross, who motions to her to get the cart back.)Rachel: I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.Woman: Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.Rachel: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!Woman: Let go!(They struggle for the cart. Finally, Rachel climbs inside of it.)Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!(She thinks it over, and then walks away.)Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.Rachel: I could not have done this without you.(Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of silence follows.)Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.Rachel: Are you sure?Ross: No.Closing Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has an icepack to his head.]Rachel: Oh, are you sure you're ok?Ross: Yeah.Rachel: Does it still hurt?Ross: Yeah.Phoebe: (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.(Monica and Joey enter.)Monica: Hi.Phoebe: Hey, how'd it go?Joey: Excellent.Monica: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.Ross: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.Monica: (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.Rachel: Where's Chandler?Phoebe: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.(Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.)Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!Phoebe: That oughta do it.[Scene: A Theater, the gang is in the audience wating for a play of Joey's to start.]Rachel: (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!Chandler: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...Phoebe: The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!(The lights dim.)Ross: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.(The lights go up on the stage, Joey, as Freud, is talking to a female patient.)Joey: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)All you want is a dingle,What you envy's a schwang,A thing through which you can tinkle,Or play with, or simply let hang...Opening Credits[Scene: The Theater, the play has ended and everyone is applauding.  As soon as the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.]Rachel: God. I feel violated.Monica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?Chandler: (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.Ross: Is it? Feels like two.Chandler: No, ten o'clock.Ross: What?Chandler: (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!Ross: Oh. Hel-lo!Chandler: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!Monica: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.Chandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'Rachel: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!Chandler: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.Ross: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.Chandler: Thank you, buddy.Phoebe: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.Monica: You could do that!Chandler: Y'think?All: Yeah!Chandler: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...Ross: C'mon! C'mon!Chandler: Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)Aurora: ...Yes?Chandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.Aurora: Yes, you said that.Chandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)Aurora: Chandler?(Joey enters from behind a curtain.  The others all talk at once.)All: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!Joey: Whadja think?(Pause)All: ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!Joey: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.All: (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.Chandler: (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)Rachel: What is it?Joey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!Phoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play![Scene: Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.]Chandler: Hey, kids.All: Hey.Phoebe: (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.Chandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.Monica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?Chandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...(A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by italics.)Aurora: ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.Chandler: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.Chandler: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.Aurora: ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?Aurora: 'We' would be me and Rick.Joey: Who's Rick?Chandler: Who's Rick?Aurora: My husband.All: Ooooohhh.Chandler: Oh, so you're divorced?Aurora: No.Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?Aurora: No, I'm still married.Chandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?Aurora: Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?Aurora: Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.All: What?!Chandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?Aurora: I suppose mainly sexual.Chandler: ...Hm.Monica: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!Phoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?Ross: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?Joey: I couldn't do it.Monica: Good for you, Joey.Joey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-(They all pretend to fall asleep.)Ross: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!All: Yeah! C'mon!Ross: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-(They all fall asleep again.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.]Rachel: Tah-daaah!Chandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.Rachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.Ross: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.Rachel: Well, whaddya think?All: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.All: Uh-oh...Monica: How-how did that happen?Rachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.Monica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.Phoebe: (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.Chandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!Phoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!Monica: That is so unfair!Ross: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!Monica: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.Ross: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.Monica: Why not?Ross: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.Monica: I could do that.Rachel: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.Monica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.Chandler: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?Ross: Monica? You're Mom.(Monica gasps.)Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!(Joey enters and he's on the phone.)Joey: (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!All: Oh my God! Whoah!Monica: Well, what's the part?Joey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"Phoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?Joey: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"Ross: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?Joey: ...I'm his (mumbles)Rachel: ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?Joey: ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!Ross: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Monica is getting the door.]Monica: Alright, alright, alright...(Joey enters with Monica's paper and hands it to her.)Joey: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.Monica: For what?Joey: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!Monica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.Joey: Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)(Chandler enters with the phone.)Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.Monica: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!Monica: I warned you...(Rachel enters from her room.)Rachel: Who is being loud?Chandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?Chandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)Rachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?Chandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)Monica: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.(She opens the door and he leaves.)[Scene: A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.]Director: (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.) Okay, everybody ready?Joey: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.Director: Lose the robe.Joey: Me?Director: That would work.Joey: Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.Director: Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.(Joey starts to the shower with a grim, determined look on his face.)Director: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?Joey: Well, I'm- I'm showering.Director: No, that was clenching.Joey: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.Director: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?Joey: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.]Chandler: God, I love these fingers...Aurora: Thank you.Chandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.Aurora: (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She starts to get up.)Chandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)Aurora: Okay.Chandler: Don't go.Aurora: Okay. Oh no, I have to.Chandler: (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.Aurora: (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.Chandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.Aurora: It's not Rick.Chandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!Aurora: No, it's-it's Andrew.Chandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?Aurora: He's... new.Chandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?Aurora: No, that's not exactly what I was..Chandler: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.Aurora: So what do you want?Chandler: You.Aurora: You have me!Chandler: Nono, just you.Aurora: Whaddyou mean?Chandler: Lose the other guys.Aurora: ...Like, ...all of them?Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?Aurora: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.Chandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'Aurora: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?Chandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...Aurora: Which one?Chandler: ...The second guy.Aurora: (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.(She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)Chandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.(She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler.  Joey is absent.]Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?(Joey enters.)All: Hey!Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?Joey: Nope.Ross: No? What happened, big guy?Chandler: (to Ross) "Big guy?"Ross: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.Joey: I got fired.All: Oh!Joey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...Rachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.Joey: My mom will.Chandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?Joey: Hard to tell, I was naked.Phoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)(Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.All: Night.Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?Monica: (determined) Uh-huh!Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?Monica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)Ross: She is a kook.Closing Credits[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, she's lying in bed wide awake.]Monica: (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is introducing Phoebe, who is playing her guitar for the crowd.]Rachel: Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.(applause)Phoebe: Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much.[Scene: The ATM vestibule of a bank, Chandler is inside.

Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)Phoebe: Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?(Monica and Rachel look at Phoebe strangely.)Phoebe: Well, I never call me.[Scene: ATM vestibule, Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone. Chandler's thoughts are in italics.]Chandler: Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.Jill: (on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.Chandler: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!Jill: (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.Chandler: Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.Jill: (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.Chandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.(Chandler strides proudly across the vestibule and Jill stares at him.)[Scene: Monica's apartment, Joey enters with a menorah, the candles lit.]Joey: Hi everyone.Ross: And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.Joey: Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.Phoebe: (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.(They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.)Rachel: That had to hurt![Scene: ATM vestibule.]Chandler: Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!(Chandler smiles at her, she smiles back sweetly.)Chandler: There you go!(He continues to smile like an idiot, and she looks frightened.)Chandler: You're definitely scaring here.Jill: (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)Chandler: Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The phone rings; it's Chandler.]Monica: Hello?Chandler: Hey, it's me.Monica: (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?Chandler: Yeah, I'm fine.

He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)Chandler: Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time has passed. The five are sitting around the coffee table talking.]Rachel: Alright, somebody.Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.All: Whoooaa!Ross: That's my sister.Joey: OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?Ross: Pheebs, what about you?Phoebe: Oh... Milwaukee.Rachel: Um... Ross?Ross: Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'All: No way!Ross: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.Phoebe: Oh, Rachel.Rachel: Oh come on, I already went.Monica: You did not go!All: Come on.Rachel: Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed.Ross: Step back.Joey: We have a winner![Time lapse, Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe are out of the room.]Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.Ross: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.Rachel: There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.Ross: Come on.Rachel: No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.Ross: (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?Rachel: I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...Ross: Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.Rachel: Yeah right.Ross: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.Rachel: (sigh) OK.Ross: But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.Rachel: You don't.Ross: Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.Rachel: Really?Ross: Mmmm.Rachel: You do?Ross: I do.Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)(Ross gets up, pleased with himself.)Joey: It's never gonna happen.Ross: (innocently) What?Joey: You and Rachel.Ross: (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?Joey: Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.Ross: No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.Joey: Ross, you're mayor of the zone.Ross: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.Ross: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)Ross: Shhhh!Rachel: What are you shushing?Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?Rachel: Ahhhh!Ross: See?Rachel: Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)[Scene: ATM vestibule.]Jill: Would you like some gum?Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?Jill: (checks) Sorry, it's not.Chandler: Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.[Scene: Monica's apartment, Phoebe is singing.]Phoebe: (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)Ross: (to Joey) OK, here goes.Joey: Are you going to do it?Ross: I'm going to do it.Joey: Do you want any help?Ross: You come out there, you're a dead man.Joey: Good luck, man.Ross: Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.Joey: OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)(Monica walks in, starts to go out on the balcony.)Joey: Hey, where are you going?Monica: Outside.Joey: You can't go out there.Monica: Why not?Joey: Because of... the reason.Monica: And that would be?Joey: I, um, can't tell you.Monica: Joey, what's going on?Joey: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.Monica: About what?Joey: He's planning your birthday party.Monica: Oh my God! I love him!Joey: (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.Phoebe: About what?Monica: My surprise party!Phoebe: What surprise party?Monica: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.Phoebe: Well, he didn't tell me.Joey: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.Phoebe: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.Monica: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Ross and Rachel are talking.]Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.Ross: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.Rachel: OK.Ross: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....Rachel: Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)Ross: What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow![Cut to inside. Monica, Joey and Phoebe are singing while outside, Ross and Rachel are trying to get the cat off of Ross' shoulder.]Monica, Joey, and Phoebe: (singing) I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the scratches on Ross' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound.]Monica: (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.(Ross flinches in pain.)Joey: Sorry, that was wax.Phoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!Ross: (nonchalantly) Yeah?[Scene: ATM vestibule.]Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.[Scene: The hallway of Monica's building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the cat's owner.]Phoebe: (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?Rachel: Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.Mr. Heckles: Er, yeah, it's mine.Phoebe: (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure?Mr. Heckles: Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.Phoebe: Wait a minute. What's his name?Mr. Heckles: Ehhhh... B-Buttons.Rachel: Bob Buttons?Mr. Heckles: Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.Phoebe: (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!Mr. Heckles: (as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.[Scene: Rachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat's owner.]Rachel: Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...(While looking at the floor for the cat, Rachel runs into a pair of legs. She slowly gets up and sees a gorgeous Italian hunk holding the cat. Who, by the way, you'll hate very, very soon. The man. Not the cat.)Paolo: (something Italian)Rachel: Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing Monopoly.]Ross: (rolling) Lucky sixes....Rachel: (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.Monica: (smitten) Hi!Rachel: And Joey....Monica: Hi!Rachel: And Ross.Monica: Hi!Paolo: (something in Italian)Rachel: (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.Paolo: (pointing at game) Monopoly!Rachel: Look at that!Ross: (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?Rachel: Oh... Italy, I think.Ross: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.Rachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!Ross: That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.(Phoebe enters.)Phoebe: Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.Rachel: Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.Phoebe: Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.Rachel: Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.Paolo: (something in Italian, he is apparently attracted to Phoebe)Phoebe: (smiling) You betcha![Scene: ATM vestibule.]Chandler: (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.(Chandler waits until Jill is looking, then starts to blow a bubble. But instead of blow one, he accidentally spits the gum out of his mouth and hits the wall.)Chandler: Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)Chandler: Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.(Chandler starts to choke.)Jill: Are you alright?(Chandler tries to save face and makes the 'OK' sign with his hands, while obviously unable to breathe.)Jill: My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better?Chandler: (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....Jill: Perfection?[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Paolo are at the window. Ross and Joey are watching disgustedly.]Paolo: (something romantic in Italian about Rachel and the stars)Ross: (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....(Rachel walks away from Paolo, laughing.)Ross: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.Ross: That's... that's classic.Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!Monica: If you want, I'll do it.(Ross looks at Joey.)Phoebe: I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won't.Rachel: God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.Phoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.Rachel: Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....[Cut to the other side of the apartment, Ross has gone over to straighten things out with Paolo.]Ross: Paolo. Hi.Paolo: Ross!(Ross notices that Paolo is standing on a step, which makes him taller. Ross gets up on the same step so he can look down at Paolo.)Ross: Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.Paolo: Thing?Ross: Thing, yes. Thing.Paolo: Ah, you... have the sex?Ross: No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...Paolo: Bed?Ross: No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.Paolo: Oh!Ross: Yeah! Se vice?Paolo: Si.Ross: So you do know a little English.Paolo: Poco... a leetle.Ross: Do you know the word crapweasel?Paolo: No.Ross: That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!(They hug.)[Scene: ATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen around his head.]Jill: Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.Chandler: OK.Jill: Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)(Chandler tries to do the same thing but the pen hits him in the head.)Jill: No, you've got to whip it.(He swings the pen hard, and it snaps back and almost hits him again.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all sitting around the table.]Phoebe: Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....

I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...(The lights come back on, and Rachel and Paolo are making out. Ross clutches his chest.)Ross: Oh.. oh... oh.Joey: Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.Closing Credits[Scene: ATM vestibule, the power has come back on.]Jill: Well, this has been fun.Chandler: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.Jill: Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya.(She leaves. Chandler presses his face to the glass door after her, stroking the window lovingly. He then turns to the security camera and starts talking to it.)Chandler: Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break.   Shelley enters.)Shelley: Hey gorgeous, how's it going?Chandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?Shelley: Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.Chandler: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...Shelley: Do you want a date Saturday?Chandler: Yes please.Shelley: Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-Chandler: He's a he?Shelley: Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...Opening Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.)Chandler: ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?Rachel: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...Chandler: You did?Rachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?Monica: I did.Phoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah.Joey: Not me.Ross: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?Ross: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler's look and abruptly stops.)Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?Phoebe: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?All: Yeah! Right!Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!Monica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.All: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.(Phone rings; Monica gets it)Monica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.Ross: (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.Rachel: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.Monica: Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.[Scene: The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian.

I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?Monica: What?Mrs. Geller: What's different?Monica: Nothing.Mrs. Geller: Oh, maybe that's it.(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)Monica: She is unbelievable, our mother is...Ross: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.Monica: Oh God!(They hug.)[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]Monica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.Mr. Geller: Not just restaurants, from our house.(The nurse comes out of Nana's room.)Nurse: Mrs. Geller?(Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana's room.)Ross: She looks so small.Monica: I know.Ross: Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.Monica: G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)Ross: Bye, Nana.(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in disbelief.

Ross and Monica go to tell the family)Ross: Now she's passed.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there.]Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?Rachel: (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.Phoebe: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.(Monica and Ross enter.)Rachel: So, um, did she...Ross: Twice.Joey: Twice?Phoebe: Oh, that sucks!Joey: You guys okay?Ross: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...Phoebe: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.Ross: Nono, she's gone.Monica: We checked. A lot.Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.Rachel: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)Phoebe: Thanks!Rachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?Phoebe: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)[Scene: Nana's house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.]Ross: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.Mrs. Geller: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)Mrs. Geller: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?Ross: (sarcastic) I don't see why not.(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)Ross: Here's my retainer![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to her father.]Mr. Geller: I was just thinking. When my time comes-Monica: Dad!Mr. Geller: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.Monica: You what?Mr. Geller: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.Monica: Define fun.Mr. Geller: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...Monica: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.Mr. Geller: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.Monica: That's probably what they'll say.Mr. Geller: I'd like that.[Scene: Chandler's Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters.]Chandler: Hey, gorgeous.Shelley: (sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-Chandler: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.Shelley: Oh! Okay! Phew!Chandler: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?Shelley: I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...Chandler: ...Quality, right, great.Shelley: Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.Chandler: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?Shelley: What? He's cute!Chandler: Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.Shelley: Is Brian...?Chandler: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.Shelley: Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.Chandler: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.[Scene: Nana's Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet.]Ross: (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?Aunt Lillian: No.Ross: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.Aunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.Mrs. Geller: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.Ross: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)Aunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes!(Ross falls back inside)Ross: Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)Mrs. Geller: That's really a day shoe.Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?Ross: (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.Aunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy.Mrs. Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?Ross: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.(He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of Sweet 'n' Lo's.)Ross: Oh my God..Mrs. Geller: Is everything all right, dear?Ross: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.(He reaches up higher and knocks down another shoebox lid. Sweet 'n' Lo's rain down on him)Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral.]Ross: (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?Monica: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?Ross: Some days it's all I can think about.Phoebe: (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.Rachel: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?Phoebe: What'd I say?Rachel: (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.Monica: Are these the shoes?Rachel: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.Ross: What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?Joey: (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?Chandler: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?(They all leave.)[Scene: The cemetary, after the funeral.]Monica: It was a really beautiful service.Mrs. Geller: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.(Joey listens to his overcoat for a second and sighs, then notices Chandler watching)Joey: What?Chandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.Joey: Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)Chandler: You're watching a football game at a funeral?Joey: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.Chandler: You are a frightening, frightening man.(Rachel steps in a patch of mud)Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!Ross: Oh, I hope they're not ruined.Phoebe: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!Ross: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)All: God! Ross!Ross: I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...[Scene: The Wake, at the Gellers' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe squatting over him, checking to see if he's injured.]Phoebe: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.Ross: What, what is it?Phoebe: You missed a belt loop.Ross: Oh! No-n-Phoebe: Okay, it's in spasm.Mrs. Geller: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)(Cut to Chandler and a woman, Andrea, reaching for the same slice of meat)Chandler: Oh, no-Andrea: Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.Chandler: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.(They shake hands. Cut to Ross emerging from a hallway, grinning inanely. He is obviously very stoned)Phoebe: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?Ross: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.Monica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?Ross: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)Phoebe: Ooh! That's so nice...Ross: ...Chandler!Chandler: Hey.Ross: (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.Andrea: (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)Ross: Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.Rachel: (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?Ross: No.Rachel: You!Ross: Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)(Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of disappointment.)Mr. Geller: Whaddya got there?Joey: (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing disability.Mr. Geller: What's the score?Joey: Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.Mr. Geller: Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)(Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game)Rachel: (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?Mrs. Geller: (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.Mrs. Geller: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.Monica: That sounds like Nana.Mrs. Geller: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?Monica: ...I can imagine.Mrs. Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.Monica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?Mrs. Geller: Tell her what?Monica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.Mrs. Geller: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?Mrs. Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.Monica: Huh.Mrs. Geller: More wine, dear?Monica: Oh, I think so.Mrs. Geller: (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you.Monica: Thank you. They're yours.Mrs. Geller: Actually they were Nana's.(There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.)Mr. Geller: Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.[Scene: Central Perk, the gang are looking at old photos.]Rachel: Hey, who's this little naked guy?Ross: That little naked guy would be me.Rachel: Aww, look at the little thing.Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?Chandler: Who are those people?Ross: Got me.Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?Ross: Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)Joey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!Ross: (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.Closing Credits[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break as Lowell enters.]Chandler: Hey, Lowell.Lowell: Hey, Chandler.Chandler: So how's it going there in Financial Services?Lowell: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?Chandler: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.Lowell: I know. That's what I told her.Chandler: Really.Lowell: Yeah.Chandler: So- you can tell?Lowell: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?Lowell: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.Chandler: He is?Lowell: Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)Chandler: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry.]Rachel: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?Terry: An advance?Rachel: It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.Terry: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.Rachel: Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.]Rachel: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?Guy: Huh?Rachel: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.(Monica enters.)Monica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?Ross: No, they're not.Monica: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.Ross: You're wrong.Monica: I am not wrong.Ross: You're wrong.Monica: No, I just talked to them.Ross: (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.(Joey enters. His face looks abnormally colorful.)Joey: Hey, hey.Chandler: Hey.Phoebe: Hey.Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?Joey: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.Chandler: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.Phoebe: What were you modeling for?Joey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?Phoebe: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.Chandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?Joey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)Chandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.Joey: Thanks.(Ross comes back to the couch.)Ross: (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.Monica: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.Ross: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?Joey: Yeah.Monica: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.Chandler: Yes, every single one of them.Monica: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?Phoebe: Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.Monica: So you're free Thursday, then.Phoebe: Yeah. Oh, can I come?Monica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?Rachel: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.Chandler: I thought it was $98.50.Rachel: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.Ross: Well, I'm off to Carol's.Phoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?Ross: (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.[Scene: Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]Ross: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?Susan: No, she's at a faculty meeting.Ross: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.Ross: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.Susan: What's it look like?Ross: Kinda like a big face without skin.Susan: Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.Ross: Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.Susan: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.Ross: (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.Susan: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.Ross: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?Susan: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?Ross: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?Susan: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.Ross: Do you uh, do you talk about me?Susan: Yeah, yeah, all the time.Ross: Really?Susan: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]Ross: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.Phoebe: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.Chandler: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.(Rachel enters.)Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?Rachel: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.Monica: Rach, here's your mail.Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.Monica: (insistently) No, here's your mail.Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.Monica: (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)Rachel: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.Monica: We all chipped in.Joey: (to Monica) We did?Monica: (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.Rachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!Monica: (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.Rachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old.Ross: Oh, I hate this story.Chandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.Rachel: Oh my god.Chandler: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.[Scene: The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.]Joey: Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.Girl: We did?Joey: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?Girl: Yeah, right.Joey: I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.Girl: Get out.Joey: I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.Girl: Really? You don't know what that means to me.Joey: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?Girl: (provocatively) Nothing.Joey: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?Girl: Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.Joey: What's wrong?Girl: I just remembered, I have to do something.Joey: Oh. What?Girl: Um, leave.Joey: Wait, wait, wait!(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says: What Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)[Scene: Central Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.]Joey: So I guess you all saw it.Rachel: Saw what?Phoebe: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey enters, upset.]Joey: Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.Chandler: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities.]Monica: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?Ross: I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.Monica: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.Ross: That's closer.(Rachel enters, excited.)Rachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.Chandler: Oh, you must stop shooping.Rachel: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.Joey: Chandler, will you just come in already?Chandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.(Phoebe takes a slice of pumpkin pie and waves it in front of Chandler's face.)Phoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!Chandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.(Chandler leaves.)Joey: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.Monica: That's not a question.Joey: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.Monica: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.Ross: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.(Ross grabs for some food, Monica slaps his hand away.)Monica: Ah!Ross: Ok, Mom never hit.(Ross exits.)Phoebe: (stirring pot) Ok, all done.Monica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.Monica: Why would we do that?Phoebe: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.Monica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.Rachel: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!(Chandler enters, running.)Chandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.Joey: The balloon?Chandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?Rachel: I can't, I gotta go.Chandler: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?Phoebe: Almost never.Monica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!Rachel: Ok.(Everyone leaves the apartment.)[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.]Carol: Anytime you're ready.Ross: Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...Carol: Just aim for the bump.Ross: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.Carol: So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.Ross: (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the group is coming back from the roof.]Rachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.Phoebe: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?Rachel: We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.Monica: No I don't.Rachel: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."Monica: No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"Rachel: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?Monica: (panicked) The oven is on.Rachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!Joey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.Monica: Well then get it, get it!Joey: That tone will not make me go any faster.Monica: (angry) Joey!Joey: That one will.(Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.)[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.]Ross: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.Carol: Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.Ross: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?(Susan enters.)Susan: Hi, how's it goin?Ross: Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?Carol: I did.Ross: Does it always, uh--?Carol: No, no that was the first.Susan: Keep singing! Keep singing!Ross: (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.Susan: I felt it!Ross: (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.[Scene: The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]Joey: Nope, not that one.Monica: Can you go any faster with that?Joey: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?Chandler: (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.Rachel: (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.Monica: I swear you said you had the keys.Rachel: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.Phoebe: Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.(Short pause.)Monica: Why would I have the keys?Rachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?Monica: But I didn't.Rachel: Well, you should have.Monica: Why?Rachel: Because!Monica: Why?Rachel: Because!Monica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)Monica: Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.(Ross enters, singing.)Ross: Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.Monica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.Joey: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.Monica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?Joey: You call that delicious?(all shouting)Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]Phoebe: Ooh.Rachel: What?Phoebe: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.(They all run to the window.)Joey: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!Phoebe: It's nice that he has someone.[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]Chandler: Shall I carve?Rachel: By all means.Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?Ross: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.Monica: (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?Joey: Oh, I will.Phoebe: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.Monica: Make a wish?Phoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?Joey: The bigger half.Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.All: That's so sweet.Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.Rachel: And a crappy New Year.Chandler: Here, here!Closing Credits[Scene: The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath. The captions read, as follows:Bladder Control ProblemStop Wife BeatingHemorrhoids?Winner of 3 Tony Awards...He's finally happy with that and walks away.][Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]Ross: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.(A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.)All: Oooh!Monica: W-wait. What is that?Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?Monica: No, no, I don't.Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?Ross: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?Ross: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]Phoebe: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.(Enter Joey)All: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.Monica: So, how'd it go?Joey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.Joey: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.Monica: So what are you gonna be?Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.Phoebe: Yeah, you wish!Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.All: Yeah, okay. Alright.Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.All: Woooo! Yeah!Rachel: Phoebe, you're on.Phoebe: Oh, oh, good.Rachel: (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!Phoebe: (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:)I made a man with eyes of coalAnd a smile so bewitchin',How was I supposed to knowThat my mom was dead in the kitchen?(shakes bell) La lalala la la la la lalala la la...(Cut to later. Everyone is totally depressed by now.)Phoebe: (Sung)...My mother's ashesEven her eyelashesAre resting in a little yellow jar,And sometimes when it's breezy...(Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy discussion)Phoebe: (Sung)...I feel a little sneezyAnd now I- (abruptly stops)Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?Max: No. No, that's- that's okay.Phoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!Chandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!David: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-Phoebe: Could you speak up please?David: (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thoughtMax: Daryl Hannah.David: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of aMax: Hard quality.David: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. (Sits down)Phoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)Joey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]Ross: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?Ross: Just a smidge.Phoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.Monica: I think it's romantic.Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?Rachel: Yeah!Phoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.Monica: What?!Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!Chandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped![Joey enters, his shoes have bells on, which jingle as he walks. He is wearing a long coat.]Joey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.(He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume)Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey!Joey: Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!(Marcel knocks over some kitchen tools)Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.[Scene: Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard.]David: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.Phoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then.David: Yuh.Phoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?David: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.Phoebe: Sure.David: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.Phoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.David: Rrrreally.Phoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.David: ...Now? Now?Phoebe: Oh yeah, right now.David: Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)Phoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?Phoebe: I can hop. (She hops onto the table)(They kiss, finally)[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?Monica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?Monica: Yeah.Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.Rachel: (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!Rachel: (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.Ross: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.Joey: Uh, four.Ross: Four.Rachel: Five.Ross: Five. (Buries his head in his hands)Rachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.Joey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?Ross: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?Rachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.Ross: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.Monica: What's the matter?Ross: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...Chandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.Ross: Really.Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.Ross: What, uh... what juggling thing?Chandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.Ross: No.Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...(Max runs in)Max: Phoebe. Hi.Phoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?Max: No. Have you seen David?Phoebe: No, no, he hasn't been around.Max: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.Phoebe: Minsk?Max: Minsk. It's in Russia.Phoebe: I know where Minsk is.Max: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.Phoebe: So when, when do you leave?Max: January first.Commercial Break[Scene: Max and David's lab, they are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]Phoebe: Hello?David: Hey!Phoebe: Hi.David: Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?Phoebe: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!Max: It'd be even more exciting if we were going.Phoebe: Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?Max: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' (Storms out)David: Thank you, Max. Thank you.Phoebe: So-so you're really not going?David: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.Phoebe: Oh don't do that.David: Please.Phoebe: Oh no no.David: No, but I'm asking-Phoebe: Oh, but I can't do that-David: No, but I can't-Phoebe: It's your thing, and-David: -make the decision-Phoebe: Okay, um, stay.David: Stay.Phoebe: Stay.(He thinks for a moment and sweeps the stuff off the table)Phoebe: Getting so good at that! (She hops on)David: It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the party has started.]Janice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)Chandler: You remember Janice.Monica: Vividly.(Someone knocks on the door; Monica gets it)Monica: Hi.Sandy: Hi, I'm Sandy.Joey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.Sandy: Yeah. That's okay, right?(Joey and Monica look at each other and shrug. Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder)Ross: Par-tay!Monica: That thing is not coming in here.Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?Monica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.Ross: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...Monica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.Ross: Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.(The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look)Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?Rachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.Phoebe: And then... your face is bloated?Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?[Time lapse. Monica and Rachel, fixed up somewhat, emerge from a bedroom]Sandy: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.Joey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.Sandy: Yeah.(They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them)Joey: Hey, kids...Ross: (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.Janice: (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!Chandler: (Imitating) But you found me!Janice: Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!Chandler: Kill me. Kill me now.(Someone else knocks on the door. Monica looks through the spyhole)Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)Fun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!Joey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?(Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back)[Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in tears]Fun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.Janice: (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-Janice: Oh, no. Oh, no.Chandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood...Janice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)(Ross is still taking photos)Chandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)(David is feeding Phoebe popcorn. Max walks up)Phoebe: Hi, Max!Max: Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.David: Wow.Max: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)Phoebe: Are you alright?David: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.(Phoebe leads David into a bedroom)Phoebe: You're going to Minsk.David: No, I'm... not going to Minsk.Phoebe: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.David: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.Phoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.David: Uh, ow.Phoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.David: I'll never forget you.Phoebe: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.Dick Clark: (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...(Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids)Joey: There y'go, kids.Chandler: (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)Joey: You seen Sandy?Chandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.Rachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.All: (in the kitchen) What?Rachel: The bll is drrbing!Dick Clark: (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...Chandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.Joey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.Phoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party except for the gang cheers and kisses)Chandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)Phoebe: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.Rachel: I can't kiss anyone.Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?Joey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.Ross: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.Chandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!Joey: Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]Ross: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.Rachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.[Scene: A Street: Monica and Phoebe are walking to a newsstand.]Phoebe: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?Monica: Why?Phoebe: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.Monica: Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.Phoebe: Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.Monica: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.(The guy walks past them)Guy: Nice hat.Monica and Phoebe: (in unison) Thanks.(The guy walks on)Phoebe: We should do something. Whistle.Monica: We are not going to whistle.Phoebe: Come on, do it.Monica: No!Phoebe: Do it!Monica: No!Phoebe: Do it do it do it!Monica: (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!(The guy turns round, startled. Monica points to Phoebe. The guy gets hit by a truck)Phoebe: I can't believe you did that!Opening Credits[Scene: Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting.]Monica: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?Phoebe: I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?Phoebe: Maybe nobody's tried this.Monica: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.Phoebe: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.Monica: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!Phoebe: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.Monica: I wish all guys could be like him.Phoebe: I know.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are telling everyone about their coma guy.]Chandler: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?Monica: He doesn't have anyone.Phoebe: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.Joey: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.Rachel: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)Jay Leno: (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.(Everyone has settled down to watch, except Chandler)Chandler: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.Rachel: No way, forget it.Joey: C'mon, she's your mom!Chandler: Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?Rachel: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!Chandler: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'Ross: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.Ross: Oh, please...(Rachel opens the door to Paolo)Paolo: Bona sera.Rachel: Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)Ross: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?Monica: Last night.Ross: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.Phoebe: Hey hey hey! She's on!Paolo: Ah! Nora Bing!Jay Leno: (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?Phoebe: Your mom was arrested?Chandler: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.Mrs. Bing: (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?All: Shhh.Mrs. Bing: (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!Jay Leno: (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?Mrs. Bing: (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...All: Awww!Chandler: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.Jay Leno: (on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...Mrs. Bing: (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.(The gang turn to look at Chandler)Chandler: ...And then he burst into flames.[Scene: The Hospital, it's a montage of Monica and Phoebe's visit to the hospital with My Guy playing in the background.  It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to him.]Monica: Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.[Next is a shot of them dragging an enormous plant into the room, then Monica knitting a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]Phoebe: What about Glen? He could be a Glen.Monica: Nah... not-not special enough.Phoebe: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?Monica: Waaay too special.[Scene: A Mexican Restaurant, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there.]Mrs. Bing: I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)Chandler: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.Mrs. Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.Ross: (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.Mrs. Bing: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down) Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.Chandler: I know I am.Mrs. Bing: Who's doing shots?Monica: Yeah.Phoebe: I'm in.Mrs. Bing: There y'go. Ross?Ross: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.(Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered)Rachel: Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.Ross: ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)[Time lapse. Ross is now clearly drunk. He is holding up a shot glass to his eye like a jeweller's eye.]Ross: Anyone want me to appraise anything?(Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.Mrs. Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.Chandler: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.[Cut to Mrs. Bing on the telephone.]Mrs. Bing: Yeah, any messages for room 226?(Ross emerges from a toilet marked 'Chicas')Mrs. Bing: You okay there, slugger?Ross: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)Mrs. Bing: What is with you tonight?Ross: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.Mrs. Bing: (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.Ross: No. It's the one he's licking.Mrs. Bing: She's supposed to be with you.Ross: You're good.Mrs. Bing: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?Mrs. Bing: No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.Ross: When?Mrs. Bing: He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.Ross: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?Mrs. Bing: No, it's you!Ross: Please.Mrs. Bing: No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...Ross: Right.Mrs. Bing: You are gonna be fine, believe me.(She kisses him on the cheek)Ross: Uh-oh...(...Then full on the mouth)(Enter Joey)Joey: Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.Commercial Break[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the next morning. Joey is getting the door in his dressing gown—it's Ross.]Ross: Hey, is Chandler here?Joey: Yeah.(Ross drags Joey into the hall and slams the door)Ross: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?Joey: Right. No big deal.Ross: Okay.Joey: In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!Ross: What code?Joey: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!(Chandler opens the door and startles them. He picks up the paper)Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?Ross: Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.Joey: Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.Ross: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.Joey: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.Chandler: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)Ross: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.Joey: Ross, how could you let this happen?Ross: I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...Joey: You don't think my mom's sexy?Ross: Well... not in the same way...Joey: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?Ross: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...(Monica and Rachel's door opens and Rachel and Paolo emerge)Rachel: Hey.Ross: Hey.Rachel: What're you guys doing out here?Ross: Well, not playing raquetball!Joey: He forgot to leave his grip size!Ross: He didn't get the goggles!Rachel: Well,sounds like you two have issues.(She and Paolo walk a little way down the hall)Rachel: Goodbye, baby.Paolo: Ciao, bela.(They kiss. Ross is watching them)Ross: Do they wait for me to do this?(Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel's apartment)Joey: So are you gonna tell him?Ross: Why would I tell him?Joey: How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.Ross: Oh...Monica: (Entering) What are you guys doing here?Joey: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!Monica: ...What did I ask?[Scene: Hospital. Phoebe is there stroking Coma Guy's hair, when Monica enters with a bunch of balloons.]Monica: Hi.Phoebe: Hi.Monica: What are you doing here?Phoebe: Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?Monica: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?Phoebe: No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?Monica: How would I know? I-I wasn't here.Phoebe: Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross is talking to Chandler. Joey is making a snack at the bar.]Chandler: Oh my God.Ross: You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.Chandler: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?Ross: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.Chandler: What?Ross: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-Chandler: (To Joey) You knew about this?Joey: Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.Chandler: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!Joey: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.Ross: Thanks, man, big help.Chandler: (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?Ross: I wasn't- I mean, I-Chandler: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.Ross: I know-Chandler: I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)Ross: Chandler-Joey: Me neither, y'know what-Chandler: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.Joey: What are you mad at me for?!Ross: Chandler-Chandler: You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)Joey: (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?Ross: Joey-Joey: Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there except for Chandler.

They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.Chandler: Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.Roger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.Chandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?Roger: Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.Chandler: Huh.Roger: I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.Chandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?Roger: It's textbook.(Joey enters with his dad)Joey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?All: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!Monica: Hey, how long are you in the city?Mr. Tribbiani: Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I don't know this one.Phoebe: Oh, this is my friend Roger.Roger: Hi.Mr. Tribbiani: Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.Roger: You too, sir.Mr. Tribbiani: (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?Joey: Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)Mr. Tribbiani: Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!(Chandler stays stonefaced)[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone.]Mr. Tribbiani: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late nowJoey: (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?(His dad nods. Cut to later. Joey is chopping mushrooms)Mr. Tribbiani: Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.Joey: Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)Mr. Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?Joey: Since then?!Mr. Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?Joey: ...I d'know.Mr. Tribbiani: Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.Joey: You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)Mr. Tribbiani: Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.Joey: Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.Mr. Tribbiani: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad's affair.]Joey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!Rachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?Chandler: (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?Rachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?Ross: Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.Chandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?Rachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.Chandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'(Door buzzer goes)Monica: Hello?Phoebe: (Intercom) It's Phoebe.Roger: (Intercom) And Rog.Monica: C'mon up.Chandler: (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.Joey: What's the matter with Rog?Ross: Yeah.Chandler: Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.Ross: What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.(Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset)Ross: Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?Roger: I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?Roger: I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...Monica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.Roger: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!Phoebe: Isn't he good?Ross: Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...Monica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!Ross: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!(Cut to later. Rachel is in tears)Rachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.Roger: That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.Phoebe: Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?Roger: Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...Phoebe: Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.Monica: You're welcome.Roger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.(He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it)Monica: Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's.]Joey: Night, you guys.(They notice that a woman is sitting by their door)Chandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.Joey: Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?Ronni: Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.Joey: I'm Joey Tribbiani.Ronni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?Chandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?Commercial Break[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey's dad is not around.]Ronni: Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.Chandler: Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.Ronni: That's a good one!(Joey's dad enters.)Mr. Tribbiani: Hey, Joe.Joey: Dad, Ronni's here.Mr. Tribbiani: Huh?Ronni: Hi.Mr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?Ronni: Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)Mr. Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...Chandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?Ronni: Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.Mr. Tribbiani: I don't want you taking that thing.Ronni: Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?Joey: Who-ah-ho.Mr. Tribbiani: We'll go to a hotel.Ronni: (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.Joey: No you won't.Ronni: No we won't.Joey: If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.Mr. Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?Joey: That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.Ronni: Wow. He's strict.Joey: Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.Ronni: Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.Chandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."Joey: Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.Mr. Tribbiani: What kinda change?Joey: Well, either you break it off with RonniMr. Tribbiani: I can't do that!Joey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!Mr. Tribbiani: Yeah, but this isJoey: I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room![Scene: Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofabed in the living room. Joey is restless.]Chandler: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?Joey: Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.Chandler: Well, you're gonna.Joey: I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...Chandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?Joey: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...Chandler: Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?Joey: No.Chandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."Joey: You really think so?Chandler: Yeah. I really do.Joey: Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)Chandler: Get off![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it.]Ronni: Hi.Monica: Hi...May I help you?Ronni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?Monica: Okay...who are you?Ronni: Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?Monica: Oh, c'mon in.Ronni: Thanks.Rachel: Hi, I'm Rachel.Ronni: Hi.Rachel: Bathroom's up there.Ronni: Great.Rachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?Ronni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?Rachel: Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib.Mr. Tribbiani: Hey. Morning, dear.(Rachel goes up to the door of their bathroom)Rachel: Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.(She opens the door and whips back the curtain. It's Joey. They both scream)Joey: (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!Rachel: I thought it was Chandler!Chandler: (Comes out of his room) What? What?Rachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!Chandler: Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters.]All: Hey, Pheebs.Phoebe: Hey.Monica: How's it going?Phoebe: Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.(Chandler laughs)Phoebe: So what's going on?Monica: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.Ross: I dunno, there's just something about...Chandler: Basically we just feel that he's...Rachel: We hate that guy.All: Yeah. Hate him.Ross: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.Phoebe: Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?All: ...No, we hate him.Rachel: We're sorry.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]Joey: Ma! What're you doing here?Mrs. Tribbiani: I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this. (Whacks him round the ear)Joey: Oww! Big ring!Mrs. Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and it folds away)Joey: Hold on, you-you knew?Mrs. Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!Joey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!Mrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.Joey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?Mrs. Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.Joey: I'm...happy...for you?Mrs. Tribbiani: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.Joey: Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.Mrs. Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?Joey: Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.Mrs. Tribbiani: That's sweet. Could I take her?Joey: With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger.]Roger: What's wrong, sweetie?Phoebe: Nothing, nothing.Roger: Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her head in his lap)Phoebe: It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.Roger: Oh. They don't.Phoebe: But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...Roger: What?Phoebe: Intense and creepy.Roger: Oh.Phoebe: But I don't. Me, Phoebe.Roger: Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.Phoebe: You're not? See, that's why you're so great!Roger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments.]Monica: So you talked to your dad, huh.Joey: Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.Rachel: Wow.Chandler: Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.Ross: So Joey, you okay?Joey: Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.Rachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.Chandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.Phoebe: (entering) Hey.All: Hey, Pheebs.Monica: How's it going?Phoebe: Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.All: Awww.Phoebe: Yeah, right.All: Aaawwwwww!!Rachel: What happened?Phoebe: I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]Phoebe: Hey, Joey. What's going on?Joey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)Monica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!Joey: Sorry. Wrong boobies.(He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks up to the shower door)Monica: Hello, Joey.(She whips back the curtain to reveal Joey's dad)Mr. Tribbiani: Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it.]Joey: I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.Ross: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.Chandler: Any contact?Ross: She lent me an egg once.Joey: You're in!Ross: Aw, right.Woman: Hi, Ross.Ross: Hey. (stutters something incoherent)Chandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...Joey: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.Ross: An egg?Joey: Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."Chandler: I think it's winning.Ross: I think it's insane.Chandler: She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.(Ross walks over to the woman, egg in hand.)Joey: Think it'll work?Chandler: No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler are there. Ross is still talking to the beautiful woman.]Monica: You can not do this.Rachel: Do what, do what?Monica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?Phoebe: 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!Monica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.Rachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?Joey: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.Chandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...Joey: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.Chandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...Joey: Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.Ross: Hi. She said yes.Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?[Scene: A Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up.]Joey: (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?Chandler: Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.Lorraine: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.Chandler: ...And what did you bring?Lorraine: She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.Chandler: Janice?(Lorraine leaves. Joey shakes his head as though to say, 'It can't be the same Janice.' Janice enters.)Janice: Oh.... my.... God.Chandler: (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.[Scene: The bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking.]Chandler: Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.Joey: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.Chandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!Joey: (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with men.]Rachel: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.Monica: Which one was Pete Carney?Rachel: Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.Rachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!Monica: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.Phoebe: I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.Monica: There's more beer, right?Phoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.Rachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.Phoebe: Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.Monica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?Phoebe: Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.Rachel: Or?Phoebe: Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.Monica: Burning's good.Rachel: Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.[Scene: The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one another.]Lorraine: You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.Joey: Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?Janice: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.Chandler: That's OK.Janice: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.(Lorraine whispers into Joey's ear.)Joey: (to Lorraine) We can't do that.Chandler: (disgusted) What? What can't you do?Joey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?(Chandler and Joey leave the table.)Joey: Uh, we might be leaving now.Chandler: Tell me it's "you and me" we.Joey: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.Chandler: Ok, you can not do this to me.Joey: You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.Lorraine: (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?Joey: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.Chandler: I hope she throws up on you.(Joey leaves with Lorraine. Chandler sits back down with Janice.)Chandler: So...Janice: Just us.Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!Janice: Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.Chandler: Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?Janice: So, do we have the best friends or what?Chandler: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?Janice: I will go for that drink.Chandler: You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?Janice: Each.Chandler: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Chandler wakes up, and finds someone else's hand on his chest. He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there.]Janice: Happy Valentine's Day!Commercial Break[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment.]Janice: Oh, I miss you already.

This is like a reunion in the hall.(Monica comes out with her cordless phone.)Monica: Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.Janice: Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously)[Scene: A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.]Ross: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.(Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like 'Why did I just say that?' Ross' ex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.)Kristin: That's funny. Who are they?Ross: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.Kristin: You mean they're lovers.Ross: If you wanna put a label on it.Kristin: Wow, uh, anything else I should know?Ross: Nope, nope, that's it.(Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.)Ross: Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.]Phoebe: Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.Monica: All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.Phoebe: Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.Rachel: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.Monica: Can we just start throwing things in?Phoebe: Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.Rachel: (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.Phoebe: Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.Monica: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.Rachel: (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.Monica: No.Rachel and Phoebe: Eww!Rachel: And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.Monica: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...(Rachel throws the alcohol in the fire. A burst of flames shoots up from it.)[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice again.]Chandler: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?Joey: I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.Chandler: Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.(Janice enters.)Janice: Hello, funny Valentine.Chandler: Hi, Just Janice.Janice: Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!(Janice kisses Joey all over. Chandler smiles.)Joey: (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.[Scene: The Chinese Restaurant.]Ross: So, um, what do you do for a living?Kristin: Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.Carol: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.Susan: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. (Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)Ross: Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?

At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.Janice: That's fine.Chandler: (surprised) It is?Janice: Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.Chandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.Janice: No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.Chandler: Oh, no I don't.Janice: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?Chandler: I did, but...Janice: You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.(She kisses him passionately,then leaves.)Chandler: Call me![Scene: The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.]Carol: It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.Ross: You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?Carol: Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.Ross: Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.Carol: That could be it.Ross: Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)Carol: Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funnyRoss: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.(They kiss.)Carol: Oh, I love you too. But...Ross: No but, no but.Carol: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.Ross: That's easy for you to say, you found one already.Carol: All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.(A beautiful woman walks by Ross, he stares at her.)Carol: Not her.Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The girls are talking with the firemen.]Fireman No. 3: We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?Rachel: So, um, will you bring the truck?Fireman No. 3: I'll even let you ring the bell.Rachel: Oh, my god.Phoebe: See, there you go, the cleansing works!Monica: They're nice guys.Rachel: Oh, they're firemen guys.[Scene: Out in the hall, the firemen are talking.]Fireman No. 1: You guys tell them you were married?Fireman No. 2: No way!Fireman No. 3: Are you kidding?

Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.Chandler: Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly.]Phoebe: Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...(Chandler comes in.)Chandler: Hey!All: Hey!Phoebe: Never mind. But it was going to be really good.Ross: What's going on?All: What is it?Chandler: So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.All: That's great!Chandler: So.... I quit.All: Why?Chandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!Monica: Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.Chandler: If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.Phoebe: So was it a lot more money?Chandler: It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.(Everyone looks at him, confused.)Rachel: ... the WENUS?Chandler: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.Joey: So what're you going to do?Chandler: I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.Phoebe: Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.Monica: (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.Phoebe: Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....Chandler: Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.Phoebe: (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!Monica: Well, what kind of food is he looking for?Phoebe: Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.Monica: (excited) Oh my God!Phoebe: Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?Chandler: Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.Phoebe: OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler walks in, wearing a suit.]Chandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?Rachel: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.Phoebe: Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?Chandler: Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.

Brian's Song!Rachel: The meeting with the guy went great?Monica: So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.Chandler: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?Monica: So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.Rachel: What are you going to make?Phoebe: (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.Rachel: (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?Monica: I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!Phoebe: Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)Ross: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?Joey: How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.Ross: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?Chandler: Who are you going out with?Phoebe: Oh, is this the bug lady?Rachel: (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.Ross: Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.Rachel: So what are you guys going to do?Ross: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.Chandler: And he's not speaking metaphorically.Joey: (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?Ross: Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.Joey: I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.[Scene: Ross's apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia's hair, and she is screaming, trying to get him off.]Ross: Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...Celia: I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...Ross: Alright...

Good.Monica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?Joey: It's creamier.Monica: Yeah, well, is that better?Joey: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?(Chandler kicks the door closed, angrily. His clothes are askew, he looks beat.)Rachel: My God! What happened to you?Chandler: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."Phoebe: That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.Rachel: (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!Monica: (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.Chandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.Monica: It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.Chandler: (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...(Phone rings. Monica answers it.)Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)Phoebe: Ten dollars an hour for what?Monica: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.Rachel: (hurt) Waitressing?Joey: Uh-oh.Monica: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...Rachel: But, but?Monica: But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.Rachel: Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.Chandler: You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)[Scene: Ross' apartment, Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon (the original, not that cruddy Urge Overkill version) is playing.

Talk... dirty.Ross: (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?Celia: Yes...Ross: Ah....Celia: Say something..... hot.Ross: (panicked) Er.... um.....Celia: What?Ross: Um... uh.... vulva.Commercial Break[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Ross are there, discussing what happened last night.]Joey: (in disbelief) Vulva?Ross: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.Joey: (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??Ross: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?Joey: What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.Ross: (deadpan) Please be kidding.Joey: Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.Ross: OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...Joey: ....yeah... what else?Ross: That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)Joey: (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?Ross: Joey, please.Joey: Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.Ross: (impressed) Wow.Joey: Alright, now you say something.Ross: I... ahem... I really don't think so.Joey: Come on! You like this woman, right?Ross: Yeah.Joey: You want to see her again, right?Ross: Sure.Joey: Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!Ross: OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.Joey: (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.Ross: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.Joey: There you go! Keep going. Keep going!Ross: I, er...(At this point, Chandler walks into the living room from his bedroom. Ross and Joey both have their backs to him, so they don't notice. Chandler sees the situation and remains quiet, watching.)Ross: I want to take my tongue... and...(Chandler is completely astounded.)Ross: ....and....Joey: Say it... say it!Ross: ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...(Chandler leans back against the wall and Ross and Joey hear him.

They slowly stop, and then very slowly turn around to see Chandler staring at them.)Chandler: (smiling)....with??Ross: (rushing to explain) Funny story!Joey: You're not going to believe this!Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.Joey: Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.Chandler: Again?Joey: And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.Chandler: (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)[Scene: Chandler's new window office, he is showing Phoebe around.]Chandler: Well?Phoebe: (excited) Wow! It's huge!

(they look outside) With a beautiful view of...Phoebe: Oh look! That guy's peeing!Chandler: (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.Phoebe: (sitting) OK.Chandler: This is great!

Rachel walks in and overhears the conversation.]Monica: (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

(she walks away towards the door)Monica: Ten dollars an hour.Rachel: No.Monica: Twelve dollars an hour.Rachel: Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.Monica: You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.Rachel: Done.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later. Rachel is waitressing, Monica is cooking.

You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.Steve: It's a lovely apartment.Monica: Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?Steve: I was just being polite, but, alright.(They leave on the tour and Rachel goes to follow them but Phoebe stops her and drags her into the kitchen.)Rachel: What's up?Phoebe: (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.Rachel: What?Phoebe: Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?Rachel: OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.Steve: (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)Rachel: Let me, let me get you some wine!Monica: Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.Steve: Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!Monica: I'm so glad you liked them!Steve: Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!Monica: Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.Steve: Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up and goes into the kitchen)Rachel: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?Steve: You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.(Rachel tries to get Monica's attention to tell her Steve is stoned. She pretends to drag on a joint, and Monica thinks she's giving her the 'OK' signal. Then Rachel does it again, inhaling deeply this time. Monica waves it off as though she doesn't believe it.)Steve: (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.Monica: (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.Steve: (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)Monica: You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...Steve: Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!Monica: No, we don't. (reaches for box)Steve: Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)Monica: Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.Steve: (childishly) No.Monica: Give them to me.Steve: Alright, we'll share.Monica: No, give me the...Steve: Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!  I'm drowning!   Help!"Monica: (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!Steve: What?Monica: What?Steve: Why?Monica: Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?(The oven goes off.)Steve: (excited) Hey![Scene: Central Perk, all are there except Chandler.]Joey: What a tool!Rachel: You don't want to work for a guy like that.Ross: Yeah!Monica: I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.Ross: Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.Phoebe: Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.(Ross gets up and goes over to the counter and Joey follows him.)Joey: (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?Ross: Oh, I was unbelievable.Joey: All right, Ross!Ross: I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.Joey: Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?Ross: Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...Joey: You cuddled.Ross: Yeah, which was nice.Phoebe: You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?Rachel: Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?Joey: Yeah, where the hell is he?[Scene: Chandler's office, he's on the phone, agitated.]Chandler: (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good!

(presses down elsewhere)Steve: No.Phoebe: What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)Steve: Aaaaahhh!!Phoebe: There you go! (She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)[Scene: Rift’s Restaurant, as seen in Mad About You, Joey and Chandler are there.]Chandler: This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.(Ursula Buffay, Phoebe’s identical twin sister, is waiting on tables in her inimitable manner.)Joey: There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?(Ursula spins around looking puzzled, quite unable to tell where the sound is coming from.)Chandler: It’s Phoebe! Hi!(Ursula notices Joey waving his hand, and comes over.)Ursula: Hi. Okay, will that be all?Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?Ursula: Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I’m here.Joey: No, no... how come you are working here?Ursula: Right, yeah, ’cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.Chandler: Can we start over?Ursula: Yeah.

But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.Rachel: No, yeah, I’ve done that.Ross: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.Rachel: I’ve never done that.(Outside in the street, Joey and Chandler arrive, to peer through the window at Phoebe, by bending down to look underneath the shop’s sign—a large steaming cup of coffee.)Chandler: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.Joey: I’m sayin’ I see a difference.Chandler: They’re twins!Joey: I don’t care.

So, um, is she fat?Joey: Not from where I was standin’.Phoebe: (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?Rachel: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?Phoebe: It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"Ross: Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go.

(pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh, (points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s, just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent until) ..who’s next?Teacher: I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?Ross: Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend...Carol: Life partner.Ross: Like buddies.Susan: Like lovers.Ross: You know how close women can get.(The teacher smiles, but her eyebrows go up. Susan and Carol pat each other affectionately.)Carol: Susan and I live together.Ross: Although I was married to her.Susan: Carol, not me.Ross: Err, right.Carol: It’s a little complicated.Ross: A little.Susan: But we’re fine.Ross: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah! That’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.[Scene : Chandler's Office, Chandler is working.](Helen’s buzzer is heard on the intercom, so Chandler presses his button, too.)Chandler: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.Helen: (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.Chandler: Oh, okay. Send her in.(He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the door.)Nina: Hi.Chandler: Hi, Nina. Come on in.Nina: You wanted to see me?Chandler: Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.Nina: Which is bad, because?Chandler: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.Nina: Your... excuse me?Chandler: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...Nina: Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. I wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."(Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once he’s lost for something to say &ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that he’s thinking correctly...)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, and the girls are dividing some Chinese takeout, while the sitcom Family Matters is playing on the TV.]Chandler: It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.Ross: It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.(Marcel scampers about, interfering with the neatness.)Monica: Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.Ross: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...(Marcel points the remote at Monica’s television, pressing a particular combination of keys. The logo SAP appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is dubbed into Spanish.)Monica: Great.Ross: Relax, I’ll fix it.Rachel: (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."Ross: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?Chandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?(Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their welcome.)Monica: Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.Rachel: Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica’s note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?(Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.)Chandler: Hey, where you been?Joey: I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.Chandler: Score.Joey: She is so hot!Chandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)Joey: Pheebs?Phoebe: (Jumping up) Yeah?Joey: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?Phoebe: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?Joey: So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.Phoebe: Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart, so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay.Joey: Cool, thanks.(He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits. Rachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.)Ross: You okay?Phoebe: Yeah I’m fine.Ross: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?(The sitcom begins with its familiar refrain, yet with a Latin lilt. Rachel and Monica do a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the rhythm.)[Scene: Lamaze class. Susan is there. Each couple has a doll, for they have just finished learning how to change a diaper. As Ross rushes in, stepping on the Rostins’ pretend baby, squashing its head flat. It bleats, in protest. He performs emergency surgery, then hands the doll back to J.C.]Ross: Sorry.Ross: Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?Susan: Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I’ll get the information.Ross: No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what’s going on.Susan: Oh, good. This’ll be fun.Teacher: Alrighty. We’re gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don’t you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy’s head.(Ross and Susan each gesture for the other to lie down.)Ross and Susan: What? What? What?Susan: I am supposed to be the mommy?Ross: Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.Susan: Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I’m a woman.Ross: I see. So what do you propose to do?Susan: I will flip you for it.Ross: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!Susan: (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.(Ross gets down like all the other mothers, cradled in Susan’s lap like all the other fathers.)Teacher: Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.(Forgetting herself, Susan does the "Mommy" action with Ross.)Teacher: Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.(Ross comes out of character to glare into the distance.)[Scene: Chandler's Office. Chandler is playing with a toy as his boss Mr. Douglas knocks and opens the door.]Chandler: Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?Mr. Douglas: Ohh, it’s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.Chandler: And?Mr. Douglas: It’s pretty ugly. We haven’t seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.Chandler: So what does this mean?Mr. Douglas: Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department.Chandler: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;Mr. Douglas: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?[Scene: Chandler's Office, later that day, Nina is in his office.]Chandler: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.(She sympathetically reaches out to fondle the inner thigh of his left leg.)Nina: Are you okay?Chandler: (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.Nina: (Taking her hand away) What?Chandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?(Nina gasps in surprise and relief.)[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe.]Rachel: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?Phoebe: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.Rachel: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?Phoebe: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.Rachel: Ooh, okay... good.(Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow enter the coffee house. They look about them as Jamie removes her coat and scarf.)Jamie: What is this place?Fran: Look, you’re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign) ..there’s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?(Jamie notices Phoebe sitting at the counter.)Jamie: I think we have an answer.Fran: What’s she doing here?Jamie: This could be God’s way of telling us to eat at home.Fran: Think she got fired at Riff’s?Jamie: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory) ..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies’ bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?Fran: I’m gonna wait till after we order. It’s her, right.Jamie: It looks like her.(Phoebe walks by, ignoring the two strangers.)Jamie: Um, excuse me.Phoebe: Yeah?Jamie: Hi, it’s us.Phoebe: (Smiling blankly) Right, and it’s me.Jamie: So, so you’re here too?Phoebe: Much as you are.Jamie: (Without moving her lips) Your turn.Fran: Err... we know what we want.Phoebe: (Philosophically) Oh, that’s good.Jamie: All we want is two Caffe Lattes.Fran: And some biscottie cookies.Phoebe: Good choice.(Phoebe turns away so that the two weird women won’t see the face she pulls, and sits down.)Jamie: Definitely her.Fran: Yeah.Commercial break[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is watching a Spanish version of The Waltons. At a nearby table sit Monica knitting, Rachel winding a ball of wool, and Chandler supplying them both from a skein which is spread between his hands.](Phoebe uses the remote to stop the Spanish by turning off the television.)Monica: I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?Chandler: Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.Monica: Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.Chandler: I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?Rachel: Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating. (Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, you’re fired, but how ’bout a quickie before I go to work?"(Joey lets himself in, carrying a large paper shopping bag.)Joey: Hey.Rachel and Chandler: Hey.(There is a loud knocking at the door through which Joey has just entered.)Chandler: You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.Monica: I’ll get it.(She rises, dragging Chandler along by the wool. Rachel has to leap over a chair to follow them. Monica opens the door to find Mr. Heckles standing there.)Monica: Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.Mr.Heckles: You’re doing it again.Monica: We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, quietly.Mr.Heckles: I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep.Rachel: You don’t even have cats.Mr.Heckles: I could have cats.Monica: (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.Rachel: We’ll try to keep it down.(The wool-bound trio returns to the table. Rachel has to rush ahead to avoid becoming tangled. Joey brings the shopping bag over to Phoebe, and takes out a nice cardigan.)Joey: Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.Phoebe: Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...Joey: Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.Phoebe: Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.(The others have been taking all this in.)Rachel: Are you seein’ her again tonight?Joey: Yep. Ice Capades.Chandler: Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.Joey: I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s uh, somethin’ about her.Phoebe: That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. You like her. Great!(The circle freezes in apprehension.)Joey: Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.Phoebe: Alright, well, maybe now it’s not okay.Joey: Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.Phoebe: Okay.(An embarrassed silence... finally broken by)Chandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!(Monica frantically bursts into action as Rachel resumes winding, tangling Chandler’s wool.)[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler & Nina are locked in a passionate embrace. Someone knocks, so they hurriedly separate to stare out of the window. Chandler’s boss opens the door.]Chandler: And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.Mr. Douglas: Nina.Nina: Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie.(She escapes, fortunately so distracting Mr. Douglas, that he misses Chandler’s expression of alarm & guilt.)Mr. Douglas: (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Nina’s shapely departure) She’s still here.Chandler: Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.(Thinking quickly, Chandler desperately tries to remember anything to do with schizophrenia....)Chandler: And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.Mr. Douglas: You’re kidding? She seems so...Chandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.Mr. Douglas: That’s unbelievable.Chandler: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.Mr. Douglas: I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside a person’s head.Chandler: Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.(Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning to follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?)[Scene: Lamaze class, Ross is again on the floor, cradled in Susan’s lap, but now Carol is cradled in his lap, and she has a pretend baby, on her lap. The teacher is showing her class a video, which is about to end.]Soothing male voice: ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.Teacher: Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our final class.(People start getting up. Ross grabs Carol’s doll to hold it upside down like a football, slapping it with his other hand.)Ross: Susan, go deep.(Susan just glares back, as Ross’s inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a bubble is about to burst...)Carol: This is impossible. It’s just impossible.Susan: What is, honey?Carol: What that woman... did. I am not doin’ that. It’s just gonna have to stay in, that’s all, everything will be the same, it’ll just stay in.Ross: Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s gonna be alright.Carol: (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know?  No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"Susan: Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.(Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his "football," then manipulates the head & limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents.)Susan: I know it’s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it’s over, we’re all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.(Ross is staring blankly into space.)Susan: I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?[Scene 13: Central Perk, the gang is gathered around Monica comforting her brother, who in a slight state of shock is cuddling a cushion for security.]Ross: I’m gonna be a father.Rachel: This is just occurring to you?Ross: I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.Rachel: (She comforts him too) Oh, you’re gonna be great!Ross: Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?Chandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.(Joey tires of this, so he gets up to leave.)Phoebe: Where’re you going?Joey: Out.Phoebe: With?Joey: (Spreading his arms wide) Yes.Phoebe: Alright, could I just ask you one question?(Joey nods his head.)Phoebe: Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?Joey: Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t, okay?(Joey walks toward the door, then hesitates and turns back.)Joey: You meant sex, right?(Phoebe buttons her lip, while the rest of the gang pretend they’re not there.)[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler is working as Nina knocks, then opens the door.]Nina: Do you have a sec?Chandler: Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?Nina: I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.Chandler: Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.Nina: Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.Chandler: Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.Nina: I am?Chandler: Sure, why not?Nina: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You’re amazing!Chandler: Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?Helen: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?Nina: What?Chandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are sharing a bowl of popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set.]Chandler: Well, I ended up telling her everything.Rachel: Oh, how’d she take it?Chandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.Monica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.(Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book, but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.)Phoebe: Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can’t, I can’t watch.Monica: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they’re gone.Phoebe: Okay.Monica: Are you alright?Phoebe: Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula thing, it’s...Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?Phoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?Monica and Rachel: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.Phoebe: Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.Rachel: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.Phoebe: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...Chandler: You’re not gonna lose him.Monica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.Phoebe: Yeah. Okay.Ross: No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.Phoebe: But he’s falling in love with her.Rachel: Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious.Phoebe: Okay... Okay.(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)Phoebe: Oh, okay, oh.(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey’s apartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her identical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joey’s shirts.)Ursula: (Surprised) Oh.(Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as though she owns the place.)Ursula: Yeah, um, may we help you?Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is taking down the Christmas lights. Monica sees her, so she leans out of the small side window.]Monica: Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?Rachel: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa! (Screams.)(Rachel slips, loses her balance, and falls over the edge..)Monica: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!(In the apartment below, Mr.Heckles is trying to relax and read his newspaper, but Rachel is helplessly dangling upside-down with her ankle wrapped up in the Christmas lights.)Rachel: (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?Mr.Heckles: See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.Opening Credits[Scene: An Emergency Room, Rachel and Monica enter.  Rachel is limping and leaning on Monica for support.]Rachel: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.(They reach the desk. The bored nurse thinks she's heard it all before.)Monica: Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.Nurse: My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?(Rachel glares at the nurse, who gives Monica a form attached to a clipboard.)Nurse: Fill this out and bring it back to me.(Monica helps Rachel over to a vacant seat.)Rachel: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.(Monica starts on the form, while Rachel catches her breath and massages her ankle.)Monica: Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?Rachel: You.Monica: Really?Rachel: Yeah.Monica: Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?Rachel: Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.Monica: (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?Rachel: Why, how much is this gonna cost?Monica: I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.Rachel: Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?Monica: Well there's not much we can do.Rachel: (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours.Monica: Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.Rachel: (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?Monica: (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.Rachel: Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!Monica: (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.Rachel: Thank you. Thank you. I love you.Monica: (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).Nurse: Why?Monica: (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine.Nurse: You are an idiot. (She hands over a blank form).Monica: (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny laugh).[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, has split up his newspaper so Joey can look at the funnies, while Ross's inappropriate joke at Lamaze class has come back to haunt him.]Ross: I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.Chandler and Joey: That's nice.Ross: No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.Joey: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.Ross: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.Chandler: What are you crazy? That's a baby!Joey: He should take the sack?Ross: Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.Chandler: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.Joey: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.(Feeling a little better, Ross fetches more coffee.)Joey: Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?Chandler: Well, only if you order stuff.Joey: I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.Ross: Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?Joey: When's that?Ross: Tonight.Joey: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?(Joey begins to contemplate his ill fortune.)Ross: You take your time.(Joey looks at his friends, thinks a bit more, then realises.)Chandler: There it is! So what're you gonna do?Joey: What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.Chandler: And your friend Phoebe?Joey: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?Chandler: Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.(Joey gestures to show that he wouldn't dare...)[Scene: The Hospital, Monica and Rachel are waiting for the doctors to arrive.   They enter and are played by Noah Wyle and George Clooney.]Dr. Mitchell: ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.(They approach the young ladies.

Rachel and Monica is telling Chandler about Rachel's incident.]Rachel: ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.Monica: Uh, you left out the stupid part.Rachel: Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."Monica: I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.Rachel: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!Chandler: Alright, what have we learned so far?(There is a knock at the door. Someone turns the music off, then the whole party runs and hides, except for Monica and Rachel who answer their door. Ross stands in the doorway, holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that it's him.)The Whole Party: (Jumping up) SURPRISE!!!(Ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. The box takes off, then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. Ross is not pleased.)Ross: What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.Rachel: Was that the cake?Ross: Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.Monica: Come on, she'll be here any minute.(The whole party gathers round as Ross puts the box on the coffee table.)Rachel: I hope it's okay.(As Ross opens the lid, everybody looks at the mess inside.)Monica: Oh...Chandler: (Reading) "Happy Birthday Peehe."Monica: Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.(Phoebe quietly wanders in, to join the tableau.)Ross: (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.Phoebe: Hey, what's going on?Ross: Oh, we just...Phoebe's Friends: (Finally noticing the guest of honour) Surprise!Phoebe: (Delighted) oh, oh, oh!

Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"Ross: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?Mr. Geller: I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;Ross: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?Mr. Geller: No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?Ross: No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.Mr. Geller: 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?Ross: Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?Mr. Geller: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.(Ross is so moved by his father's charming story, that he stops eating.)Mr. Geller: So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?Ross: No, we can go to Williamsburg.Mr. Geller: Eat your fish.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is just getting off of the intercom and turns off the TV which is still in the SAP mode.]Monica: Rachel, the cute doctors are here.Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay, coming!(Monica opens the door for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Geoffrey.)Monica: Hi, come on in.Dr. Mitchell: Hey.Monica: Hi, Geoffrey.Rachel: Hi.Dr. Rosen: Ah here, we brought wine.Dr. Mitchell: Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?Rachel: Oh, that's great. Look at that.Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, how's the ankle?Monica: It's uh...(Rachel discreetly coughs to warn her.)Monica (as Rachel): ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.Rachel (as Monica): You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... (They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!(Rachel joins Monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. Rachel checks that the doctors aren't listening, then lowers her voice anyway.)Rachel: Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.Monica: It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.Rachel: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?Monica: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?(Back at the couch, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Rosen have concerns of their own.)Dr. Mitchell: So?Dr. Rosen: So... they sss-still seem normal.Dr. Mitchell: That's because they are.Dr. Rosen: (Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...Dr. Mitchell: Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this. (Dr. Rosen obeys.)(Meanwhile, back at the sink.)Monica: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.Rachel: (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...Monica: Sure, every time, you're such a princess...Rachel: You know what?Monica: What?Rachel: You know what?Monica: What!?Rachel: You know what?Monica: (getting angry) What!!?Rachel: Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.(Rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an open-mouthed Monica in her wake.)Rachel: Hello! Here we go!Dr. Rosen: This is a great place. How long have you lived here?Rachel: (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.(Rachel tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair.)Dr. Mitchell: Really?Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, what do you do?Rachel: (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.Dr. Rosen: Good for you.Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.Dr. Rosen: This hummus is great.Dr. Mitchell: God bless the chickpea.Monica: (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!(The doctors don't know what to make of all this.)Rachel: (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?Monica: (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.Rachel: (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.Monica: (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!(Rachel lets her anger show too. Hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. The telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. Finally both guys jump up, and Michael wins.)Dr. Mitchell: (on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.Monica: (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...(Monica glares triumphantly across the room, scaring Rachel who also stands up.)Rachel: Would you excuse me for a second?Monica: (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.(Completely undone by Monica's verbal destruction, Rachel almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr. Mitchell looks philosophically at Dr. Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar.)Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Monica sit round the coffee table, playing Scrabble. Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation.]Rachel: (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...") ...dead!(Monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until she's distracted by Marcel as he clambers all over her nice furniture.)Monica: Ross, he's got the remote again.Ross: Good. Maybe he can switch it back.(Marcel changes channel to Bugs Bunny, who is speaking in Spanish.)Ross: Maybe not.(Meanwhile, Rachel has taken another call, from a nurse she'd hoped never to hear from again.)Rachel: Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.(All animosity forgotten, Rachel holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to her friend, who stands up in concern.)Rachel: It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...Rachel and Monica: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?Monica: I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!Rachel: Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.Monica: (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)Rachel: What?Monica: We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.Rachel: Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.Monica: Thank you.Rachel: Okay, let me just change.Monica: Yes.(Rachel goes to her room.)Joey: (entering quietly) Hey.Ross and Chandler: Hey!Monica: Hi.Phoebe: Trouble?Joey: Your sister stood me up the other night.Phoebe: Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?Ross: Well did you try calling her?Joey: I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.(Phoebe wants to be angry with Joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain and disbelief, she knows that it isn't his fault.)[Scene: Riff's, Phoebe is entering. Ursula returns with two plates of chicken, but she only has time to set one on the table, when...]Phoebe: Hey.(Ursula turns in surprise.)Ursula: Oh!Phoebe: Um you, you got a minute?Ursula: Um, yeah, I'm just... (waving dismissively at the concept) ..working.(Ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down. Departing customers walk right past the pair. Sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman looks most annoyed as Ursula sets his meal down in front of her. The girls sit.)Phoebe: So.Ursula: Uh-huh.(Ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years. Phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.)Phoebe: Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.(Ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while Phoebe removes a present from her bag.)Ursula: Oh, wow! You remembered! (Opening it) Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!(She laughs at the childhood memory. Phoebe smiles at being able to make her point.)Phoebe: Right, like the kind you...Ursula: Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.(Ursula gets up to fetch a box from her bag by the counter.)Phoebe: How'd you know I was coming?Ursula: Um, yeah, um, twin thing.(Ursula puts the box directly into Phoebe's hand. Phoebe brightens.)Phoebe: I can't believe you did this.(Phoebe opens the box, to find something familiar inside.)Phoebe: I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.(Phoebe's smile hardens as she packs the cardigan away.)Phoebe: So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?Ursula: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.(Ursula resumes eating her lunch..)Phoebe: Does he know?Ursula: Who?Phoebe: Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.Ursula: He is? Why?Phoebe: You got me.Ursula: Right.(A waiter comes over for the stolen chicken. Ursula turns to him.)Ursula: Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?(The man gives up, shaking his head.)Phoebe: So, um, are you gonna call him?Ursula: What? (Indicating the departing waiter) Do you think he likes me?Phoebe: No, Joey.Ursula: Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her food) Do you want some chicken?Phoebe: No. No food with a face.Ursula: You have not changed!(Ursula's eyes dance as she laughs and smiles, simply glad to be back with her sister.)Phoebe: Yeah, you too.(Trying not to wrinkle her nose, Phoebe smiles back realising it's down to her to make up for her negligent sister. Meanwhile, Ursula still hasn't received her side salad, but when she attempts to attract the waiter's attention, he ignores her.)[Scene: The Emergency Room. The officious admissions nurse is again on duty. Rachel and Monica enter, looking worried. As they approach the desk, Rachel adopts a winning smile, while Monica struggles to smile at all.]Rachel: (as Monica) Hi, remember us?Nurse: (Grimacing) Mmm hmmm.Monica: (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...Nurse: You're that stupid.Monica: (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.Nurse: Well, you know your insurance will cover that.Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.(The girls escape with a new form.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is neglecting the game of Scrabble, for he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters about.]Chandler: Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.Ross: Uh-huh.Chandler: Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.Ross: Do you have a point?Chandler: You know, you think I would.(Instead of scampering, Marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.)Chandler: What's up with the simian?Ross: It's just a fur ball.Chandler: Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?Ross: Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.Chandler: No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.Ross: I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?(The unvoiced hissing continues. In alarm, Ross and Chandler look at the monkey, who is now in some distress.)[Scene: The Emergency Room, Monica sits with Rachel, who is filling out an honest form at last. Ross and Chandler hurtle in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled in Ross's arms. They dash up to the admissions desk. Ross is frantic.]Ross: You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!(Hearing her brother's voice, Monica gets up to stand behind Chandler, followed by Rachel.)Nurse: (angrily) You go get that animal outta here.Ross: No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.Monica: What's goin' on?(Ross and Chandler turn at the voice...)Chandler: Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.Rachel: Oh.(..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and Ross and Chandler whip around once more. Monica and Rachel recoil slightly.)Nurse: Excuse me... This hospital is for people!Ross: Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!(Ross's vigorous protest is attracting attention.)Dr. Mitchell: I'll take a look at him.(Rachel, Monica, Ross and Chandler whip around for a second time, in formation.)Rachel and Monica: Oh, thank you.Monica: Michael.Dr. Mitchell: Rachel.Rachel: What?Monica: (as Rachel) Monica.Rachel: (as Monica) Oh.Monica: (as Rachel) Hi.Rachel: (as Monica) Hi.(Monica smiles to cover her embarrassment, but Rachel sadly looks away...)[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is playing "She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not" with the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.]Phoebe: (as Ursula) Hey.Joey: Urse...(Phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.)Joey: ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.Phoebe: (as Ursula) Listen, um...Joey: No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."Phoebe: (as Ursula) I'm sorry.Joey: I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?(Phoebe is almost thrown by this.)Phoebe: (as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!Joey: You don't drink.Phoebe: (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!Joey: Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)Phoebe: (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.Joey: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?Phoebe: (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?Joey: (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.Phoebe: (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.Joey: Then, uh, then I'm sorry.(He sinks to the sofa, saddened by Ursula's ultimatum, while Phoebe follows, touched by Joey's good heart.)Phoebe: (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.Joey: I know...(He looks up at her face and Phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. Joey's voice becomes soft and warm.)Joey: I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.Phoebe: Really?(Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts "Oh, whoa!!" to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. A thoughtful Joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...)Joey: Pheebs?Phoebe: (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)[Scene: The Hospital, Marcel lies on the operating table while recovering from the anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. Ross sits beside him, as a smiling Chandler, Monica and Rachel look on.]Ross: He looks so tiny.(The door bursts open, and Joey and Phoebe rush in.)Joey: We just got the message.Phoebe: Is he alright?Ross: Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.Chandler: We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'(Ross does not approve of Chandler's daft theory.)Ross: Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.Chandler: (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?Ross: No, why?Chandler: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.(Ross does approve of this, but he's still not sure. The tiny figure stirs.)Monica: Oh, look, he's waking up!Ross: (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?(All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad!)Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is there.  Rachel is looking out of the window and Ross is handing out some Chinese takeout.  There's a small SAP in the corner of the screen.]Ross: Aqui est�. (Here it is!)Monica: �A qui�n pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's chicken?)Chandler: �Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)(Rachel points out of the window.)Rachel: �Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est� haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look, Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)(The others rush to the window for a look.)All:�Ewww! (Ewww!)(Joey enters, happy again.)All: �Hola, Joey! (Hi, Joey!)Joey: �Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)(Marcel grabs the remote.)Monica: Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got the remote.)Ross: �Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t like the program!)(Everybody laughs.)(The whole gang is helping Rachel mail out resumes while whistling the theme from The Bridge on the River Kwai.)Ross: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.Monica: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?Chandler: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.Rachel: Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'Ross: Rach, did you proofread these?Rachel: Uh... yeah, why?Ross: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.Rachel: (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?Joey: Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are sitting at a table. Rachel is working. Monica and Phoebe enter.]Monica: Hey, guys.Chandler and Ross: Hey.Rachel: Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly): Did you bring the mail?Monica: Lots of responses.Rachel: (to Monica): Really? (out loud): Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica): OK, read them to me.Phoebe: (reading): Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...

No. (crumpes up letter)Phoebe: Wow!Rachel: What?Phoebe: (reading): Your Visa bill is huge!Rachel: (grabs the bill) Give me that!(Camera cuts to Chandler and Ross at table.)Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?Ross: I don't know.Chandler: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?Ross: No, it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)Chandler: ...little playthings with yarn?Ross: What?Chandler: Could you want her more?Ross: Who?Chandler: (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.Ross: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!Rachel: Hi! How are you?Ross: We're fine, we're fine.Rachel: OK. (walks away)(Ross keeps staring at her, head on table. Chandler smacks him with a newspaper. Joey enters, Ross and Chandler laugh at him.)Joey: Shut up!Chandler: We're not—we're not saying anything.Phoebe: What?Ross: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.Joey: Thank you.Chandler: (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...Joey: There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?Ross: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'Chandler: And then he did.Rachel: Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?Phoebe: Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?Ross: No, women are welcome to play.Phoebe: Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?Chandler: There just don't happen to be any women in our games.Joey: Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.Girls: Oh, yeah, right.Monica: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!Rachel: Really.Monica: I mean, that's a typical guy response.Ross: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?Girls: No.Rachel: But you could teach us.Guys: No.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]Chandler: (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.Monica: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.Rachel: Oh, good for you!Phoebe: Congratulations!(Microwave timer goes off. Monica gets up.)Chandler: OK Phoebs, how many do you want?Phoebe: OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.Ross: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't—you can't do...Rachel: Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)Ross: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.Rachel: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.Ross: Oh, you're... (gives up)(Monica comes back to the table with plates of food.)Monica: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.Phoebe and Rachel: OOooooo!Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)Chandler: (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...Monica: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...Ross: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...Phoebe: But... I'm ready, so, just deal.Chandler: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.(Time lapse.)Monica: (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!Phoebe: (to Joey): Oh I see, so then, you were lying.Joey: About what?Phoebe: About how good your cards were.Joey: Heh... I was bluffing.Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?Rachel: OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)Guys: Whoa, whoa, whoa!Chandler: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.Rachel: Settle what?Chandler: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...Ross: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.Rachel: Oh. Right.Joey: You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?Monica: Hell no, we'll pay!Phoebe: OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.Monica: And you know what? We want a rematch.Ross: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.Rachel: (to Ross): So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.Ross: (pause)...Yeah.Chandler: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.Ross: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)Joey: (pause)...Yeah?Ross: I'm not a nice guy.[Scene: Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]Ross: Alright boys, let's eat.Chandler: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?Ross: You still on that?Chandler: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"Ross: You are way off, pal.Joey: No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.Ross: Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any more. I just—I...(Marcel makes a screeching noise in background.)Ross: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?(Marcel puts a CD in the player.)Ross: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.(The Lion Sleeps Tonight starts to play. Marcel starts to dance.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe are there.]Rachel: (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?Monica: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.Phoebe: Ha. Ha, ha.Monica: What?Phoebe: Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.Monica: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.Rachel: Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?Monica: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.Rachel: Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview!

I would be shopping... for a living!(Knock on door.)Monica: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!Aunt Iris: Is Tony Randall dead?Rachel: No.Monica: I don't think so.Rachel: Why?Aunt Iris: Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.Monica: What?Rachel: Oh my God!Monica: Really?Aunt Iris: No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe): Nice earrings.Phoebe: Thank y... (thinks about it)Aunt Iris: Girls, sit down.Monica: Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...Aunt Iris: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.[Scene: Ross's apartment, everyone but Rachel is seated around his table. The Lion Sleep Tonight plays in the background.]Phoebe: Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?Ross: Alright.(Ross shuts off the CD player. Marcel runs into the bedroom and slams the door.)Ross: I'm gonna pay for that tonight.(Knock on door. Ross opens it. Rachel enters.)Rachel: Hi!Ross: Hey.Rachel: Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?Rachel: Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!All: That's great! That's wonderful!Rachel: Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...Monica: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.Joey: Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?(The guys all duck under the table.)Monica: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?Phoebe and Rachel: Yes, we should. I think we should.Ross: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?Rachel: No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.Ross: Alright.Rachel: Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)Commercial Break[Scene: Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]Ross: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.Joey: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.Phoebe: Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should know that this money is cursed.Joey: What?Phoebe: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.Ross: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...Rachel: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)Monica: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.Rachel: Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there ready for another poker game.]Ross: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.Rachel: Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.Monica: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?Phoebe: (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.(Ross gets up from the table.)Monica: Excuse me, where are you going?Ross: Uh... to the bathroom.Monica: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?Ross: I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)Joey: Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.Joey: That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.Monica: Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)Phoebe: (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.(Ross comes back from bathroom.)Ross: Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green.Rachel: Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)(Time lapse.)Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?Chandler: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!Joey: Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?Phoebe: Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)Rachel: I'm in.Monica: Me too.Joey: Me too. Alright, whattaya got.Ross: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down cards)Rachel: Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...(Ross stands up.)Rachel: And your fly's still open...(Ross looks down.)Rachel: Ha, I made you look....(Time lapse.)Rachel: I couldn't be inner. Monica?Phoebe: Monica, in or out?Monica: (slams down cards) I hate this game!(Joey slides a plate away from Monica towards Chandler, who hides it under the table.)Phoebe: OK Joey, your bet.Joey: Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.Phoebe: Ross?Ross: Oh, I am very in.Phoebe: Chandler?Chandler: Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)Phoebe: Me too. Rachel.Rachel: Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?Ross: No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?Rachel: I'm not telling. (collects chips)Ross: Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)Rachel: No..!Ross: Show them to me!Rachel: Get your hands out of there! No!Ross: Let me see! Show them!Chandler: Y'know, I've had dates like this.Rachel: (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...Phoebe: Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.(Ross is visibly upset.)Ross: First of all, I'm not losing...Rachel: Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)Ross: Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...Rachel: (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.Ross: (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.Rachel: (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.(Rachel walks into kitchen to talk on the phone.)Rachel: Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)(Rachel goes back and sits down. The rest don't know what to say.)Monica: Sorry, Rach.Phoebe: Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.Rachel: Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.Joey: Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.Rachel: Yes, we do. (pause)Monica: Alright, check.Joey: Check.Ross: I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)Chandler: Call.Phoebe: I'm in.Rachel: I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it in)Ross: I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.Rachel: Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?(Everyone says no and folds, except for Ross, who thinks about it.)Rachel: (to Ross): Loser?(Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe back their chairs away from the table.)Ross: No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)Rachel: What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?(Ross thinks it over, finally sits down and picks up his cards.)Ross: I'm in. (throws in chips)Rachel: How many you want?Ross: One. (Rachel gives him the card.)Rachel: Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?Ross: I bet two dollars. (throws it in)Rachel: OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)Ross: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)(The other four look amazed at the large pot.)Rachel: See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.(Monica gets up, looks in Rachel's purse.)Monica: Rachel, there's nothing in it.Rachel: OK, then get me your purse.(Monica gets Rachel her purse.)Monica: OK, here you go. Good luck.Rachel: (to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.Phoebe: ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)(Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.)Ross: (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.Joey: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?(Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.)Chandler: (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?Ross: Fifteen.Chandler: Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)Joey: Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)Ross: Thank you.Chandler: Good luck.Ross: (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?(Long pause as they both look at each other.)Rachel: (lays down cards) Full house.(Ross stares at her. Thinks about it. Puts cards on table, face down.)Ross: You got me.(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)Joey: (to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.Chandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!Ross: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing Pictionary at Monica's apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane.]Chandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!(Timer goes off.)Rachel: Oh, time's up.Monica: (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.Joey: Oh!Phoebe: That's a bird?(Monica glares at Phoebe.)Phoebe: That's a bird!(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)Rachel: OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)Chandler: Go.(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)Ross: Uh.... bean! Bean!(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)Joey: (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!Rachel: Yes!Monica: That, you get? That, you get?(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was about to throw it.)[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is talking to a customer.]Rachel: Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Monica enters with some mail.]Monica: Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.Rachel: Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!Monica: Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?Rachel: Oh. Right. ...Oh great.Monica: What is it?Rachel: Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!Monica: Barry who you almost...?Rachel: Barry who I almost.Monica: And Mindy, your maid of...?Rachel: Mindy, my maid of. Oh!Monica: (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are eating Chinese.]Ross: Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?Rachel: What?Ross: Hi.Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.Ross: Really.Rachel: No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.Ross: Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...Ross: Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.Rachel: Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?Ross: Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...(Enter the other four)Monica: Hi.Ross: ...Gets interrupted. Hi!Rachel: Hi, how was the movie?Monica: Wonderful!Phoebe: So good!Joey: Suck-fest.Chandler: Toootal chick-flick.Phoebe: I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...Joey: Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.Monica: There was nudity!Joey: I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.Monica and Phoebe: Hugh! Hugh Grant!Ross: Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.Chandler: They're still just friends, right?Rachel: (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!Ross: That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.Monica: Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?Ross: 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.[Scene: Joe-G's Pizza, the guys are there.]Chandler: I can't believe we are even having this discussion.Joey: I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.Chandler: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?Ross: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.Joey: She really said that?Ross: Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.Joey: 'Tonight' tonight?Ross: Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...Chandler: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.Ross: Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.Chandler: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a soap opera.]Rachel: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)[Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachel's.]Joey: How could you lose him?Rachel: I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-Monica: Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?Rachel: I don't know. The left one.Monica: Which ones?Rachel: Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.Phoebe: (Entering) Hey.All: Hi.Phoebe: Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?Chandler: Rachel lost Marcel.Phoebe: Oh no, how?Monica: He- he pooped in my shoe.Phoebe: Which one?Monica: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.Phoebe: No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...Rachel: C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?Joey: Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?Chandler: Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.Rachel: Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!Monica: Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.Rachel: Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?Monica: Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.(They all leave)Rachel: Anybody wanna trade? Oh...[Cut to a hallway in the building, Monica and Phoebe are knocking on a door. Mr. Heckles emerges.]Mr. Heckles: Whaddyou want?Monica: Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?Mr. Heckles: I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?Monica: No!Phoebe: Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?Mr. Heckles: I wasn't ready for it.Monica: A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?Mr. Heckles: Saw Regis Philbin once...Phoebe: Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)Mr. Heckles: You owe me a waffle.[Cut to Monica and Rachel's.]Rachel: (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.Ross: Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?Rachel: Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?Ross: Yeah. You, uh, you want some?Rachel: Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?Ross: Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-Rachel: Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.Ross: Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine)Rachel: Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.Ross: Oh, what? What-what?Rachel: Y'know Marcel?Ross: ...Yeah?Rachel: Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.[Cut to outside the window, with Ross reacting with disbelief. The shot pans back until we see Marcel sitting on the window ledge.]Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]Ross: (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.Rachel: I know, I know, I'm sorry-Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.Rachel: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?Intercom: Animal Control.Rachel: See? I've even called Animal Control!Ross: You called Animal Control?Rachel: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?Ross: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.Rachel: O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...Ross: That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!(A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it)Rachel: Hi, thanks for coming.Luisa: (Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?Rachel: Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)Ross: Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.Rachel: Turned out it was a hat.Ross: Cat!Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!(Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)Monica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.Luisa: Marcel?Ross: My uncle Marcel.Phoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?Luisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?Phoebe: Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?Phoebe: Yes, but there isn't always time!Monica: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.Luisa: Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!Rachel: Yeah!Luisa: Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!Rachel: Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!Monica: The Luisa from home room!Rachel: Yes!!Luisa: You have no idea who I am, do you.Monica: No, none at all.Rachel: None.Luisa: Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch!Rachel: What?!Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?Luisa: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)Phoebe: Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.[Cut to another part of the building. We see Marcel jump in through a window and run down some stairs, then Chandler and Joey come down from the upper floor without noticing.]Chandler: Marcel?Joey: Marcel?Chandler: Marcel?Joey: Marcel?(They come to a door and silently agree to try it. A very sweaty woman emerges)Woman No. 1: Hi, can I help you?(Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment)Chandler: Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...Joey: A monkey.Chandler: Yes have you seen any?Woman No. 1: No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?Joey: Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?Woman No. 1: Of course.Joey: Oh. Then, no.(Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend)Woman No. 2: Did I put too much rum in here?(Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances)Woman No. 1: Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She starts to shut the door)Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.Joey: Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?Chandler: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.Joey: We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.(The women quickly shut the door)Chandler: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.Joey: Marcel?Chandler: Marcel?![Cut to Monica and Phoebe searching the basement.]Phoebe: Marcel?Monica: Marcel?Phoebe: Marcel?Both: Marcel?Phoebe: Oh-my-God!Monica: Whaaat!Phoebe: Something just brushed up against my right leg!Monica: What is it?Phoebe: Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.(Marcel makes a monkeyish noise. He is sitting in the corner)Monica: Look, Phoebe!Phoebe: Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!(Luisa appears on the stairs)Luisa: Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)Monica: What're you gonna do?Luisa: Just a small tranquiliser.(In slow motion we see Phoebe look at Marcel, then at Luisa. She jumps toward Marcel just as Luisa fires the gun.)Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?Phoebe: Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.Monica: Oh gosh.[Cut to Marcel walking along a hallway. He notices a banana on the floor and picks it up. The hand of an unseen person grabs him and carries him away. Then cut to Ross and Rachel on the street outside.]Ross: Marcel?Rachel: Marcel?Ross: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.Rachel: Ross, you don't know that.Ross: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.Rachel: Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!Ross: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!Rachel: Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.Ross: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...Rachel: Ross.Ross: I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...Rachel: Ross.Ross: Oh, forget it, okay?Rachel: Ross!Ross: What? What?(A man carrying a box of bananas walks past them. They stare for a minute and then hobble after him)Both: Hey! Hey, Bananaman!(Scene 4: Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas. He bangs on the door)Phoebe: Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.(Mr. Heckles opens the door)Ross: Hi, did you order some bananas?Mr. Heckles: What about it?Ross: Gimme back my monkey.Mr. Heckles: I don't have a monkey.Rachel: Then what's with all the bananas?Mr. Heckles: Potassium.(There is a monkey-like noise from within and Ross pushes past Mr. Heckles and enters his apartment)Ross: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?(Marcel jumps into view wearing a pink dress. Everybody gasps)Ross: Marcel! What've you done to him?Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.Ross: Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)Ross: C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)Luisa: (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.Ross: Okay, gimme my monkey back.Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey.Luisa: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.Mr. Heckles: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.Ross: Alright, I want my monkey.Luisa: No!Rachel: Oh, c'mon, Luisa!Luisa: Sorry, prom queen.Ross: (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.Rachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!Luisa: Nope.Rachel: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress off Marcel.]Ross: It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.Rachel: Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.Ross: Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...Rachel: Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...Ross: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?Rachel: That'd be good.Ross: Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...(Barry bursts in)Barry: Rachel.Rachel: Barry?!Barry: I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.Ross and Rachel: Oh!Ross: We have got to start locking that door!Closing Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler are looking through Monica's high school yearbook]Monica: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?Phoebe: Nope.Monica: That's because I'm in front of them.Chandler: Eh. I thought that was an alp.Monica: Well, high school was not my favourite time.Joey: I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.Monica: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?Phoebe: Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.]Chandler: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.Joey: No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.Monica: (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!Rachel: Oh, that is so sick.Chandler: I feel violated. And not in a good way.Phoebe: How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]Chandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...Monica: So have you called her yet?Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.Monica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.Phoebe: Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!Chandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.Joey: Her answer machine?Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.Phoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?Phoebe: Okay, they're just talking...Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?Phoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!Ross: What? What? What?!Phoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!Chandler: (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.All: Oh!... Right!Chandler: Hey Rach!Monica: How'd it go?Rachel: Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...Phoebe: Not a good day for birds...Rachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...Ross: That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?Rachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!Ross: That's, that's nice twice!Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?Joey: Duh, where've you been?Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?(Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)Chandler: Yes!Rachel: Why?Chandler: I have my reasons.Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?Rachel: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it![Scene: Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.]Rachel: Wow... Wow!Barry: Yeah.Rachel: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.Barry: Nooo, it wasn't.Rachel: Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.]Chandler: (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!Ross: What was with the dishes?Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.Monica: (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!Phoebe: Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!Monica: Great, now he's waving back.Joey: Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!Monica: What kinda stuff?Joey: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.Phoebe: You cook naked?Joey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.(A pause as they look at Chandler.)Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.[Scene: Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.]Barry: What's the matter?Rachel: Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.Barry: No, it was. It was very very good.Rachel: Well, what about Mindy?Barry: Oh, way, way better than Mindy.Rachel: No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?Barry: Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.Rachel: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.Barry: (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.Rachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..Barry: We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.(Pause as Rachel realises...)Rachel: I had a bra.(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.)Bobby: Hey, Dr. Farber.(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)Barry: All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)Rachel: What?!Bobby: I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.(Rachel glares at him.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.]Chandler: Can I use your phone?Monica: Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?Joey: Maybe she never got your message.Phoebe: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?Chandler: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.(He calls and quickly hangs up.)Phoebe: How many beeps?Chandler: She answered.Monica: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.(Rachel enters.)All: Hey! Hi!Phoebe: How'd he take it?Rachel: Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)Monica: (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?Rachel: Oh, do I?Monica: Uh huh.Rachel: (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.Monica: You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?Ross: You-you had what?Phoebe: Sex in his chair.Ross: What, uh... what were you thinking?Rachel: I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!Rachel: Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?(Ross flounders.)Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.Ross: It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.Phoebe: Where are you going?Ross: (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)Chandler: Hello? Hello?(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops.  As she talks on the phone, an elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)Rachel: (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.Chandler: So how's Mindy?Rachel: Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.  Chandler is sitting and staring at his phone.  Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler.]Monica: Brrrrrrr!(Chandler clutches at his phone before realising.)Chandler: Hell is filled with people like you.Joey: (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!(Rachel enters from her room.)Joey: (ducking) Get down!Rachel: Get down?Chandler: ...And boogie!Rachel: Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.Monica: Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.Rachel: Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..Joey: (intrigued) Yeah?Rachel: And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..Joey: ..Naughty!Rachel: Right, I'll see you guys later...Joey: Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...(Joey exits.)Chandler: Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?Monica: Why don't you just take it with you?Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?Monica: Why don't you just call her?Chandler: I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.Monica: Do you?Chandler: No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...Monica: Don't you have to pee?Chandler: 'S'why I'm dancing...[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters.]Rachel: Mindy.Mindy: Hey, you.Rachel: Hey, you.... So, what's up?Mindy: Um.. we should really be sitting for this.Rachel: Sure we should... So.Mindy: Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.Rachel: Okay.Mindy: Will you be my maid of honour?Rachel: Of course!Mindy: Oh that's so great!Rachel: Was that all you wanted to ask me?Mindy: That's all!Rachel: Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?Mindy: That's not all.Rachel: Oh sure it is!Mindy: Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.Rachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?Mindy: Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.Rachel: (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.Mindy: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!Rachel: What? What's what you were afraid of?Mindy: Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.Rachel: What?Mindy: I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.Rachel: Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.Mindy: What do you mean?Rachel: (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?Mindy: Oh no.Rachel: Oh, I am so sorry.Mindy: No me, I am so sorry...(They hug and Joey enters.)Joey: (watches them for a while) Oh my.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking, and Chandler is still staring at his phone.]Ross: Four letters: "Circle or hoop".Chandler: Ring dammit, ring!Ross: Thanks.Joey: (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?Chandler: What?!Joey: I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.Chandler: (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!Monica: Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.Joey: Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?Chandler: Nngghhh!!!!!!!Joey: (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.Ross: "Heating device."Phoebe: Radiator.Ross: Five letters.Phoebe: Rdtor.Joey: (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney's a woman.Monica: So she's a woman! So what?Joey: Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like—(Listens)—Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..Monica: Joey!!Joey: (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.Monica: The green dress? Really?Joey: Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.Monica: (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo![Scene: Barry's Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters.]Rachel: Hey. Got a second?Barry: Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...Mindy: Hello, sweetheart.Barry: Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?Rachel: Uh, we are here to break up with you.Barry: Both of you?Mindy: Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.Barry: I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!Rachel: Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?Barry: ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.Rachel: Even when we were having sex in that chair?Barry: (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!Mindy: (to Rachel) You did it twice?Rachel: Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.Mindy: Okay...Barry: (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.Barry: Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.(Barry exits)Rachel: Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.Mindy: Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.Rachel: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!Mindy: Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.Rachel: Oh God.Mindy: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?Rachel: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]Monica: You okay?Rachel: Yeah.Monica: Really?Rachel: Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.Monica: Aww... (They hug)(Joey enters and looks on approvingly.)Joey: Big day.Closing Credits[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]Joey: All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...Phoebe: You know he's gay?Ross: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?Danielle: (entering) Chandler?Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.All: Hi. Hi.Chandler: What are you doing here?Danielle: Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.Chandler: ...I'm, I'm okay.Danielle: Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?Chandler: That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...Danielle: You got it.Chandler: Okay.Danielle: G'bye, everybody.All: Bye.Phoebe: Whoo-hoo!Monica: Yeah, there you go!Ross: Second date!Chandler: ...I dunno.Rachel: You don't know?!Chandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?(They all groan and hit him..)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is looking at papers.]Joey: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?Monica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!Rachel: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.Monica: I know. It's just such reckless spending.Ross: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.Chandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.Monica: That's me.Phoebe: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)Ross: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-Rachel: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase.Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey...Ross: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.Rachel: (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!Ross: What?Rachel: Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.Opening Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room.]Rachel: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.Monica: This woman's living my life.Rachel: What?Monica: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.Rachel: You're not an artist.Monica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.Rachel: Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.Monica: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.Rachel: (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...Monica: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?Rachel: (Yawning) Nooo...Monica: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]Chandler: How about Joey... Pepponi?Joey: No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.Chandler: Joey... Switzerland?(The waitress brings their coffee.)Joey: Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.Chandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?Joey: Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.Chandler: Well, it does not ring a bell with me...Joey: (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.Chandler: Might wanna try Joseph.(Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.)Joey: Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!Chandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]Rachel: Hey.Phoebe: Hey.Monica: Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.Phoebe: What are you doing?Monica: (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.Rachel: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?Monica: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.Rachel: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.Phoebe: This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.[Scene: A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]Monica: What d'you think?Phoebe: Lotsa things.(They go in and sit down.)Rachel: Which one do you think she is?(The teacher comes up to them.)Teacher: May I help you?Monica: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.Teacher: You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.Rachel: What does she mean?Phoebe: I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare shoes)Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?Teacher: (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!Rachel: She could be you.(Music starts)Teacher: Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!Phoebe: (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!Monica: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)Rachel: What? You just click when they click.Teacher: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)Phoebe: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.Monica: Great. It's gym class all over again.Phoebe and Rachel: Aww.Teacher: Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.Monica: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)Woman: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?Teacher: She's your partner.Woman: Hi. I'm Monica.Monica: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.Woman: (Fake Monica) Monana?Monica: Yeah. It's Dutch.Fake Monica: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)Monica: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.Teacher: And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]Ross: (Mortified) Hi.Chandler and Joey: Hey.Joey: Where've you been?Ross: At the vet.Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?Ross: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.Joey: (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.Ross: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.Chandler: So what does this mean?Ross: I'm gonna have to give him up.Commercial Break[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.  They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.]Joey: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?Ross: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.Joey: Isn't there any way you can keep him?Ross: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.Ross: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.Chandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)Phoebe: Hey. We found her, we found the girl.Chandler: What?Joey: Did you call the cops?Rachel: Nope. We took her to lunch.Chandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.Monica: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.Ross: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.Chandler: ...Take off their hats!Phoebe: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]Rachel: No way. No way did you do this.Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.Monica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!Fake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!Rachel: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)Fake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.Monica: 'Scuse me?Fake Monica: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?Monica: Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.Fake Monica: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.Monica: What?Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?Monica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?Monica: Uh-huh.Fake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.Monica: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse.  Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]Ross: (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.Phoebe: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?Rachel: Oh, somebody will.Joey: (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?Chandler: You're kidding.Joey: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!Chandler: Y'know, you'd think I would've.Joey: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?Phoebe: ...Flame Boy.[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?Dr. Baldhara: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?Ross: Yes.Dr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?Ross: No-no, he's, he's very docile.Dr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?Ross: Well I, I don't know. Why?Dr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?Ross: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...Dr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?Dr. Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)Chandler and Joey: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.Joey: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...Chandler: ...He's in.Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!Dr. Baldhara: You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk.]Monica: Yo- hooo!Rachel: Where the hell've you been?Monica: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.Rachel: Are you drunk?!Monica: Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.Rachel: Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...(Monica is drinking from the tap)Rachel: Monica? Monica!Monica: Water rules!Rachel: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?Monica: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.Rachel: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!Monica: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!(The phone rings and Rachel answers)Rachel: Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.Monica: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.Rachel: What?Monica: They've arrested Monica.[Scene: New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]Monica: Hi.Fake Monica: Hey.Monica: How are you?Fake Monica: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?Monica: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.Fake Monica: That I was not expecting.Monica: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.Fake Monica: Oh. Thanks.Monica: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!Fake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.Monica: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?Fake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?Monica: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.Fake Monica: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.Monica: Not necessarily...Fake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.Monica: Um, I'm not actually Amish.Fake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?[Scene: Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]Teacher: You by the door. In or out?Monica: In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)Teacher: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!Monica: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it![Scene: The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]PA: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.Phoebe: Okay.

Uh, it's a monkey.Ross: Just, just say what you feel.Joey: Marcel, I'm hungry.Ross: That was good.Rachel: (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.Ross: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.All: Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)Ross: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.(Marcel is put in a cage and taken away.)Closing Credits[Scene: A Theater, there is a casting session going on for a play.]Actor: (Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...Casting Director No. 1: That's fine, thank you.Casting Director No. 2: Next.

What is it?Chandler: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.Phoebe: I could be a secretary.Chandler: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal.

We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.Carol: Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.Ross: What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie?

What's that, water breaking?Nurse: (to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe.[Scene: The Hall, Ross and Susan are arguing.]Ross: Please. This is so your fault.Susan: How, how is this my fault?Ross: Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.Susan: Yeah?

You're threatened by me.Ross: Oh, I'm threatened by you?Susan: Yes.(Phoebe has heard them arguing and comes down the hall, taking them into a broom closet.)Phoebe: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!Ross: Yeah, Susan.Phoebe: Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.(Phoebe goes to leave the room, but the door is locked.)Phoebe: Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?Commercial Break[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross and Susan are trying to get out.]All: Help!Ross: I'm having a baby in here!

So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?Rachel: (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?Dr. Franzblau: No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.Rachel: Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.Dr. Franzblau: No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.Rachel: Oh.Dr. Franzblau: I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?Rachel: I'm a waitress.Dr. Franzblau: Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...Rachel: (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.Dr. Franzblau: I'm gonna go check up on your friend.Rachel: Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)[Scene: The Hall Outside Lydia's Room, Joey is walking up to Lydia's room with balloons, but before he enters he sees that the baby's father has arrived.

So is this her?Lydia: No, this is a loaner.Guy: I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.Lydia: I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey smiles) So, did you see who won the game?Guy: Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.Lydia: Yeah, they're not so bad.(Joey closes the door and ties the balloons to the knob.

Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.Susan: The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.Ross: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?Susan: You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.Ross: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.Phoebe: This is so great.Ross: You wanna explain that?Phoebe: I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm sorry, you were fighting.[Scene: Carol's Room, she is ready to give birth. Everyone is there except for Phoebe, Ross, and Susan, who are in the broom closet.]Carol: Where are they?Monica: I'm sure they'll be here soon.Rachel: Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.Joey: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.Chandler: (to Joey) You are really frightening me.(Carol suddenly screams in pain and grabs Chandler by the shirt.)Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?Dr. Franzblau: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.Nurse: All right, honey, time to start pushing.Carol: But they're not here yet!Dr. Franzblau: I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.Carol: Oh, god.[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross has used a broom to open the air vent in the ceiling.

It's Ben... to the rescue!Ross: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.(Ross and Susan lift Phoebe up into the vent.)Susan: What do you see?Phoebe: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.(A janitor opens the closet door from the outside.)Ross: Phoebs, It's open! It's open!(Ross and Susan run to the delivery room, leaving Phoebe dangling from the vent.)Janitor: (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs![Scene: Carol's Room, Ross and Susan rush in.]All: Push, push!Ross: We're here!Carol: (irked) Where have you been?Ross: Long story, honey.Dr. Franzblau: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need—(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have this?Nurse: All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!All: Good luck!(Everyone heads for the door.)Chandler: (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?Nurse: Out!Dr. Franzblau: All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.Ross: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?Carol: (straining) Not.... helping!Dr. Franzblau: You're doing great, you're doing fine.Ross: (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.Susan: What do you see? What do you see?Ross: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.Susan: Oh, look at that.Carol: What does he look like?Ross: Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.Carol: Really?Phoebe: (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!Ross: Oh, thanks, Pheebs!(They look up towards the vent and wave at Phoebe.)[Scene: The Delivery Room, Carol is holding the infant.]Susan: No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.Ross: (thinking) How 'bout Ben?Susan: I like Ben.Carol: Ben.

You gotta...Monica: (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.Closing Credits[Scene: The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Ben's eyes.]Ross: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns)(Chandler comes into the picture.)Chandler: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)(The rest of the group come into the picture.)Monica: He is so amazing.Rachel: Oh, I know. Look at him.Joey: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing.

(grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!(Ross is practically drooling over Rachel at this point.)Ross: (quietly) That would be nice.(Chandler, annoyed with Ross's fawning, makes a 'pfft' noise.)Rachel: Pardon?Chandler: Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)(Joey is looking at his check.)Joey: Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.Chandler: Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.Joey: I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.Chandler: (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)Joey: Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.Ross: (overhearing) What kind of research?Joey: Oh, just, y'know.... science.Ross: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)Joey: (sigh)... It's a fertility study.(Rachel laughs.)Monica: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.Joey: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project.

What does she think of your little science project?Joey: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?Monica: Man's got a point.Joey: Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.Chandler: Crazy bitch.Joey: Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.Monica: Joey... we always know what you mean.[Time lapse. Chandler and Joey are making the fire, Monica and Phoebe are inside. Ross enters, carrying luggage.]Phoebe: Hey.Monica: Hey.Ross: Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)Phoebe: How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?Ross: I'm going to China.Phoebe: Jeez, you say one thing, and...Monica: You're going to China?Ross: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me...

Ross is gone.]Melanie: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'Joey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.Chandler: (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)Monica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?Rachel: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)Monica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?Joey: Well, not so good.

Heh, heh.Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?Joey: What do you mean?Monica: Y'know, just be there for her.(Long pause... Joey looks confused.)Joey: Not following you.Monica: Think about it.(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.)Rachel: OK, I'm guessing this is from...(Melanie smiles.)Rachel: Well, thank you, Melanie.Chandler: (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.Rachel: (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)Rachel: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!Phoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!Joey: (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.Melanie: There is a little child inside this man!Chandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.(Rachel picks up the next gift.)Rachel: Who's this from?Chandler: Oh, that's Ross's.Rachel: Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.Phoebe: Remembered what?Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!Chandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)Phoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.Monica: I can't believe he did this.Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)Rachel: What did you just say?Chandler: (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.Rachel: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?Chandler: (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....Rachel: Oh.... my God.Chandler: (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....Joey: (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]Rachel: I mean, this is unbelievable.Phoebe: I know. This is really, really huge.Chandler: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.Phoebe: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.Chandler: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?Rachel: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?Joey: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.Rachel: Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)Chandler: (quickly) H-He's in China!Joey: The country.Monica: No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.Chandler: What about the time difference?Monica: From here to the airport?Chandler: Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!Monica: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?Rachel: I-I-I don't know.Chandler: Well then maybe you shouldn't go.Joey: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.Monica: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.Rachel: I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.Phoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help?(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)Rachel: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)Chandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)[Scene: Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a 'How To Speak Chinese' tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there.]Ross: (something in Chinese)Flight Attendant: Alright!Ross: Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)(Rachel runs into the airport, trying to catch Ross, moving people out of the way.)Rachel: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....(Rachel gets up to the jetway.)Flight Attendant: Hi!Rachel: Hi.Flight Attendant: May I see your boarding pass?Rachel: Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.Flight Attendant: Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.Rachel: No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...Flight Attendant: No no no! Federal regulations!Rachel: OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.Flight Attendant: Alright. What's the message?Rachel: Uh... I don't know.[Cut to the Jetway, the flight attendant enters, walks past Ross, and approaches an older man with his wife who is also wearing a blue jacket.]Flight Attendant: Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.Man: (confused) What?Flight Attendant: It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.Man: (to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.[Scene: Joey's Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together.]Melanie: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!Joey: Heh, heh. It was nothin'.Melanie: Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing his chest)Joey: (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.Melanie: (surprised) M-Me again?Joey: Sure! Why not?Melanie: Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.(Joey starts to kiss her.)Melanie: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.Joey: How do you mean?Melanie: I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding the wrapping paper from one of Rachel's gifts.]Monica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?Rachel: I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.Monica and Phoebe: Sure.Rachel: I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.Monica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!Phoebe: Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.Monica: Another good point.Phoebe: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.Rachel: (confused) Huh?Phoebe: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?Monica: Why isn't it working out?Rachel: I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?Rachel: No!Monica: Does he not make enough money?Rachel: No, I'm just....Phoebe: Maybe there's someone else.Rachel: Wha...Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?Rachel: No! There is.. there is noone else!Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his bedroom door.]Chandler: Hey, big...Joey: Shhhh!Chandler: (quietly) ...spender.Joey: She's still asleep.Chandler: So how'd it go?Joey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?Chandler: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.Joey: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!Chandler: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.Joey: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.Chandler: I didn't know you had another level.Joey: I know! Neither did I![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her bedroom.]Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?Rachel: Yeah.Monica: Oh, from who?Rachel: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.Monica: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?Rachel: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.Monica: Oh, why?Rachel: Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...Monica: (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!Rachel: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...Monica: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.(Door buzzer goes off. Rachel answers it.)Rachel: Who is it?Intercom: It's me, Carl.Rachel: C'mon up.Monica: Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.]Joey: Seven hundred bucks!Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?Joey: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.Chandler: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?Joey: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.]Carl: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!(Rachel looks bored. At this point, Ross—a figment of Rachel's imagination— shows up on the balcony and starts talking to her.)Ross: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.Rachel: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.Ross: Fine, just stop thinking about me.(She tries, and Ross disappears momentarily. He reappears, standing closer to her.)Ross: Can't do it, can you?Rachel: So I'm thinking about you. So what?Ross: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?Rachel: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....Carl: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!Ross: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.Rachel: Ross, it's too hard.Ross: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.Rachel: Ross, you're like my best friend.Ross: I know.Rachel: If we broke up, and I lost you...Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?Rachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?Ross: (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?Rachel: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.Ross: Well, start looking.(They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)Rachel: Wow.Carl: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!Rachel: Right! You're right!Carl: Heh... y'know?Rachel: You know what?Carl: What?Rachel: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.(Rachel leaves.)Carl: But...[Scene: Airport. Madonna's Take A Bow plays in the background as Rachel waits at the gate with flowers.]Rachel: (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel's message to gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]Man: For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)Ross: Oh, hey, hey, I got that.(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)Julie: Oh, thanks, sweetie.Ross: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.Julie: Really?Ross: Yeah.Julie: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?Ross: No, no, they will. I just... uh...Ross and Julie: Can't wait.Ross: Come on, they're gonna love you.[Cut to a close-up of Rachel, eagerly awaiting Ross's arrival... not knowing he is getting off the plane with another woman.][Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is recapping last season, and as she talks we see a montague of scenes from Ross and Rachel.]Phoebe: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?Opening Credits[Scene, The Airport, continued from last season, Rachel is waiting for Ross to come of the plane, when she sees he's coming off with another woman.]Rachel: Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.)Ross: (seeing her) Rach!Rachel: Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with the flowers.)Ross: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?Rachel: What?Ross: You're bleeding.Rachel: I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)Ross: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.Rachel: These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly, thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.Julie: (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.Rachel: Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is waiting for Rachel to return from the airport with Ross.]Chandler:  No way!Monica: I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!Phoebe: Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?Joey: Um, this?Phoebe: Yes.Monica: Guys, you got your hair cut.Chandler: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.Phoebe: 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.Rachel: (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.Chandler: Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.(She hits Chandler.)Rachel: (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter) You, you slowpokes!Ross: That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?Joey: What up?!Ross: Everyone, this is Julie.Rachel: (out of breath) Julie.All: Ohh. (Happily) Hi!Julie: Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.Ross: And bus.Julie: Oh my god.Ross:  The screaming guy?Julie:  And the spitting?Ross: You gotta hear this story.Julie: We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...Ross: 200 at least.Julie:  ...and this guy...Rachel: And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.Monica: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?Julie: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.Rachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?Monica: (to Julie) It's an expression.Ross: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.Julie: And then we've gotta get some sleep.Ross: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.Chandler: Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.(Ross and Julie exit)Rachel: Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler enter.]Ross: Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?Rachel: Yeah, sure.Ross: Thank you.Chandler: Hey, Rach, can I get...Rachel: Did you talk to him?Chandler: Not yet.Rachel: Then, no.(He goes to sit down next to Ross.)Chandler: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.Ross: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?Chandler: God?Ross: It was you, pal.Chandler: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.Ross: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.Chandler: Well, you owe me one, big guy.Rachel: (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.Ross: I didn't order lemonade.Rachel: Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.Ross: But...Rachel: Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So uh, what did you find out?Chandler: He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.Rachel: How is that the silver lining?Chandler: You have to really wanna see it.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and the gang is watching Sumo wrestling on TV.]Ross: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.[Cut to Phoebe and Monica in the kitchen.]Monica: Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?Phoebe: Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?Monica: No, although now that's what I'm thinking.Phoebe: All right, so what were you thinking?Monica: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?Phoebe: Ohh! No.Monica: Why not?Phoebe: Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.Monica: No you're not.Phoebe: I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.(The phone rings.)Joey: (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)Ross: (on phone) Hello? Hi.Chandler: (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?Joey: Needs some clothes altered?Chandler: No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.Joey: Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All right, when was 1990?Chandler: Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!Ross: (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up either.Rachel: She didn't hang up either!Ross: Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...Rachel: (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.Ross: Rachel! I'll just call her back.Rachel: Okay!Ross: (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)Rachel: (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.Monica: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.Rachel: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)Chandler: Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.]Joey: (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.Monica: (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.Phoebe: I'm still on "no."Rachel: (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?Joey: No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.Phoebe: What's goin' on?Rachel: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.Chandler: What stupid thing did you do?Paulo: (entering from Rachel's room) Bon giorno tutti!Phoebe: Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]Rachel: Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)Monica: Rachel, how did this happen?Rachel: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.Phoebe: Where?Rachel: At his apartment. Is this juice?Joey: Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?Rachel: Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.Monica: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.Chandler: People do stupid things when they're upset.Monica: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.(Ross and Julie enter.)All: Hi!Ross: Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.Paulo: (entering) Hey, hey Ross.Ross: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?Paulo: I do Raquel.Ross: (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.Rachel: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?Ross: No, not a problem.Rachel: Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.Phoebe: (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.Chandler: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.Joey: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.Chandler: Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?Monica: (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.Phoebe: All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.Monica: I promise.Phoebe: All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.[Scene: Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is finishing with her haircut and Monica is whincing.]Phoebe: All right, that's it, I quit.Monica: What? I didn't say anything.Phoebe: Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.Monica: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.Phoebe: Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.Monica: How who wears it?Phoebe: Demi Moore.Monica: Demi Moore is not a he.Phoebe: Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.Monica: That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.Phoebe: Oh.  Oh!Monica: Oh my God!Phoebe: Oh my God!Monica: Oh my God!Phoebe: Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?Monica: She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!Phoebe: Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.Monica: I know![Scene: Frank's tailor shop, Chandler is getting his pants measured.]Frankie: How long do you want the cuffs?Chandler: At least as long as I have the pants.(Pause as Frankie resumes his work.)Frankie: I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.(He slowly measures it up his leg, and Chandler makes a rather surprised face.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is recovering from her haircut, Phoebe is playing her doctor and is coming in from the bedroom.]Rachel: How is she?Phoebe: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.Ross: How's the hair?Phoebe: I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.Joey: Can we see her?Phoebe: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.Ross:  Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that meant.)(They go into the bedroom leaving Joey and Rachel alone.)Joey: How're you doing?Rachel: I'm okay.Joey: Ooh, that bad, huh?Rachel: What?Joey: Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.Rachel: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.Joey: You gotta tell Ross how you feel.Rachel: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?Joey: What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.Joey: Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.Chandler: (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!Joey: Frankie? What're you talking about?Ross: (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)Chandler: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.Ross: What?Joey: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.Chandler: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...Ross: What?Chandler: Cupping.Joey: That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?Joey: What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later that day.  Monica is now out and about.]Monica: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.Ross: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)Monica: Thank you. My hair is very amused.Chandler: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.Phoebe: (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.Ross: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.Rachel: (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?Ross: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"Rachel: Well, can I talk to you for a sec?Ross: Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)Joey: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...Chandler: That's ok.[Out on the balcony]Ross: What's goin' on?Rachel: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all (Ross is laughing), what?Ross: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?Rachel: No. No-no-no-no.Ross: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.Rachel: Really?Ross: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?Rachel: No, I think that was the whole all.Ross: Okay.  Okay. (They hug.) Okay.[Cut back inside, Joey is on the phone.]Joey: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.Closing Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Julie is wanting to get her hair cut from Phoebe.]Julie: I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?Phoebe: Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.Julie: Really?Phoebe: You wanna do it right now?Julie: Great! (Julie leaves)Phoebe: (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?Rachel: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.Rachel: You're welcome.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are showing off Ben to the gang.]Monica: (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)Phoebe: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?Susan: Oh, is he hungry already?Carol: I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)Chandler: You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)Joey: (joins him) I gotta get one, too.Ross: (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?Chandler: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?Ross: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.Joey: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.Ross: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.(They go back into the living room)Ross: Carol?Chandler: Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?Carol: Sure.Joey: Uh, does it hurt?Carol: It did at first, but not anymore.Joey: Chandler?Chandler: So, uh, how often can you do it?Carol: As much as he needs.Joey: Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, the gang is all there.]Julie: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?Rachel: Yeah, I forget which ones.Julie: Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?All: No thanks.Julie: (To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. (Ties it back up for her)Rachel: (to Julie) Thank you.

You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?Monica: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?Chandler: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.Monica: But I'm...Phoebe: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.Ross: (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?Monica: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.Ross: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.Monica: You're welcome.Phoebe: Woof, woof.[Scene: A Department Store, Joey is selling men's cologne.]Joey: (A guy walks by) Bijan for men?

(to Joey) Maybe some other time?Joey: (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol is dropping Ben off for Ross to watch.]Carol: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.Ross: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.Susan: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.Rachel: Oh, this is so cute.Susan: Oh, I got that for him.Ross: My mommies love me. That's clever.Monica: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—(Sees Rachel is watching)—Hi, Jew! (Walks into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)Rachel: Did you just say Hi, Jew?Monica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are eating, and Phoebe is preparing Ben's milk.]Phoebe: Ben, dinner!Ross: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.Phoebe: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)Chandler: What did you just do?Phoebe: I licked my arm, what?Ross: It's breast milk.Phoebe: So?Rachel: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.Joey: What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)Chandler: What did you just do?Ross: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?Phoebe: You won't even taste it?Ross: No!Phoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.  Rachel is entering the living room from her bedroom as Monica enters.]Monica: Hey, where is everybody?Rachel: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?Monica: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.Rachel: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and notices she also grabbed a receipt.)Monica: Okay.Rachel: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?Monica: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.Rachel: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?Monica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.Rachel: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?Monica: Judy.Rachel: Who?Monica: Julie.Rachel: What?!Monica: Jody!Rachel: You were with Julie?Monica: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.Rachel: Oh. Oh my God.Monica: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.Rachel: Yeah, right.  Sure!Monica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)Monica: That is not true!Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?Monica: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?Rachel: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? (Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. (Exits.)Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ben is playing in his crib while Chandler and Ross are leaning against the rim and are completely asleep.]Monica: (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.(There's a knock on the door which is answered by Phoebe.)Carol and Susan: Hey! (This wakes Chandler and Ross up)Carol: How did we do?Phoebe: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.Ross: I did not freak out.Carol: Why'd you freak out?Ross: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.Carol: My breast milk is gross?Susan: This should be fun.Ross: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.Chandler: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.Carol: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. (Holding out a bottle.)Ross: (jumping away) That would be no.Phoebe: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.Joey: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...Susan: Cantaloupe juice.Joey: Exactly.Ross: (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.Susan: Uh huh.Ross: Oh, you've tasted it.Susan: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.Ross: (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.)[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is wiping down the peninsula counter as Joey enters dressed like a cowboy.]Chandler: Howdy.Joey: (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.Chandler: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.Joey: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.Chandler: (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.Joey: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.Chandler: (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?Joey: Yeah I guess you're right.Chandler: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.Joey: I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)Chandler: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel is cleaning up and Monica is pleading with her.]Monica: I don't know what else to say.Rachel: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.Monica: I feel terrible, I really do.Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?Monica: Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?Rachel: Yes.Monica: It's that terrible?Rachel: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually (starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.Monica: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, (starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.Rachel: I love you too. (They hug.)Phoebe: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and sits down.)Monica: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?Rachel: (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that.Monica: (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)Phoebe: Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)[Scene: The Department Store, Joey and the Hombre man are facing off in Joey's section.]Joey: Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.Hombre Man: I heard ya.Store Guy: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?Hombre Man: Ready.Joey: Yeah, I'm ready.(An old West style showdown starts with Joey and the Hombre Man staring each other down as the store guy slowly lets in the first customer while Joey and the Hombre Man get ready to draw.  In slow motion they spot the customer, eye each other, draw, and as the customer walks into the middle Joey's bottle misfires but the Hombre Man spays it into the customer's eyes.)Customer: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!Store Guy: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?Hombre Man: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.Annabelle: (seeing the end result) My god, what happened?Joey: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?Annabelle: Sure.(They walk off into the sunset, at least a picture of one.)[Scene: Central Perk, Julie and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]Julie: So.Rachel: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?Julie: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.Rachel: Really? Me?Julie: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.Rachel: Well, you're not totally paranoid.Julie: Oy.Rachel: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.Julie: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?Rachel: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.Julie: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.Rachel: All right, Julie.Julie: Bye. (Gets up.)Rachel: Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, another showdown is occuring, only this time its between Ross, a plate of cookies, and the breast milk.  They've been eyeing each other for a while now, and Chandler and Joey are getting bored.  He checks his Ross and in frustration, shoves his watch in front of Ross's eyes as if saying, "Hurry it up already!"  Finally, Ross scratches his head, does that again, itches his nose, scratches his head, grabs the bottle, takes a big swig, and piles several cookies into his mouth.]Ross: (with a mouthful) That's not bad.CHANDLER: Hey.MONICA: So how was Joan?CHANDLER: I broke up with her.CHANDLER: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.RACHEL: Come on, they were not that huge.CHANDLER: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?JOEY: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.CHANDLER: You or me?ROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.JOEY: You guys are messin' with me, right?ALL: Yeah.JOEY: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."PHOEBE: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.CHANDLER: Maureen Rosilla.ROSS: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.(knock)MONICA: Hello, Mr. Heckles.MR. HECKLES: You're doing it again.MONICA: We're not doing anything.MR. HECKLES: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.RACHEL: You don't have birds.MR. HECKLES: I could have birds.MONICA: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.MR. HECKLES: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.RACHEL: All right, bye-bye.CHANDLER: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.ROSS: We'll give you Janice.PHOEBE: I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."RACHEL: "Oh, my, god."JOEY: "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"MONICA: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.RACHEL: We won. We won!MONICA: Mr. Heckles.RACHEL: How did this happen?MR. TREEGER: He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.MONICA: That's terrible.MR. TREEGER: I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'. You never know.MR. TREEGER: You never know.PHOEBE: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!CHANDLER: Ok, Phoebe.PHOEBE: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.JOEY: Such as?PHOEBE: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?PHOEBE: Nah. Not really.ROSS: You don't believe in evolution?PHOEBE: I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.ROSS: Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?PHOEBE: Yeah, I just don't buy it.ROSS: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.PHOEBE: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.ROSS: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?PHOEBE: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.(knock)CHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.MR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.MONICA: What can we do for you?MR. BOYLE: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".MONICA: Well, what about his family?MR. BOYLE: He didn't have any.RACHEL: Ok, so let's talk money.MR. BOYLE: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.MONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!RACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?CHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crapJOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?ROSS: How can you not believe in evolution?PHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!ROSS: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.PHOEBE: Really? You can actually see it?ROSS: You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.PHOEBE: See, I didn't know that.ROSS: Well, there you go.PHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?CHANDLER: Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."JOEY: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.CHANDLER: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.RACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.MONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.RACHEL: What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.MONICA: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.RACHEL: Well, what about my stuff?MONICA: You don't have any stuff.RACHEL: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?MONICA: No.RACHEL: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.MONICA: Mmmmm.RACHEL: Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.ROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.ROSS: Please tell me you're joking.PHOEBE: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.ROSS: No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--PHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.ROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?JOEY: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.CHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.PHOEBE: He's even kind of cute.JOEY: "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.CHANDLER: Funniest? Heckles?JOEY: That's what it says.CHANDLER: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?PHOEBE: I'd call that excessive.CHANDLER: Whoa!JOEY: What?CHANDLER: Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.JOEY: So, you were both dorks. Big deal.CHANDLER: I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?JOEY: Have you been here all night?CHANDLER: Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.JOEY: Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.CHANDLER: Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.JOEY: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.CHANDLER: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?JOEY: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.CHANDLER: How do you know that? How?JOEY: I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.CHANDLER: You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?JOEY: Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?CHANDLER: Yeah, I understand.JOEY: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?CHANDLER: You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.JOEY: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.CHANDLER: (on phone) Hi, it's me.JANICE: Oh, my, god.PHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?CHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?ROSS: You remember Janice, right?CHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.JANICE: Helloo!!CHANDLER: Oh, my, god!JOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.JANICE: Hey, it's everybody.CHANDLER: Janice, you're--JANICE: Yes, I am.CHANDLER: Is it--?JANICE: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.CHANDLER: Congratulations.JANICE: Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.CHANDLER: You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?JANICE: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.MONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?RACHEL: What?MONICA: Hide the Lamp.RACHEL: Monica, let it go.MONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?RACHEL: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.PHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.ROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.PHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.ROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.PHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?ROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.PHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.ROSS: What?PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?RACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.MONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.RACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?MONICA: Phoebe, tell her!PHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.RACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.CHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.RACHEL: Ok, you win.MONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.CHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.PHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?CHANDLER: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!MONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.CHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.RACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.MONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.RACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.MONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.CHANDLER: In a bad way?MONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue.

It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is on the phone.]RACHEL: Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying.

I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.PHOEBE: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.ALL: Huuh.MONICA: Well, didn't you?PHOEBE: I might have.MONICA: I can't believe you didn't tell me.PHOEBE: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.MONICA: What have I not told you?PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know.

You told me it was a nubbin.ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?JOEY: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.ALL: Yeah, show it.

The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.CHANDLER: Joey was in a porno movie.ALL: Huuh.CHANDLER: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.ROSS: You were in a porno?JOEY: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.MONICA: That is wild.ROSS: [to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?JOEY: What happens if you flick it?[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, and Julie are sitting on the couch.]ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?CHANDLER: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.JULIE: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?RACHEL: [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.

For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.ROSS: [holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?CHANDLER: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .

Like we can afford to go here and there.PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?

Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?CHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.ROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?WAITER: Do I dare ask?MONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.ROSS: That sounds great.

It'll be fine.JOEY: Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.MONICA: Ok.ROSS: I hear ya.CHANDLER: We can talk about that.PHOEBE: Well, then...Let's.ROSS: I, I just never think of money as an issue.RACHEL: That's 'cause you have it.ROSS: That's a good point.CHANDLER: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?JOEY: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.ROSS: Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?RACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.MONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.ROSS: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?CHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.ROSS: Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.PHOEBE: No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.ROSS: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.MONICA: All of us.CHANDLER: Together.ROSS: Not at the concert.RACHEL: Ok.JOEY: Yeah.RACHEL: Thank you.JOEY: Thanks.PHOEBE: Yeah.CHANDLER: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?(at Monica and Rachel's)CHANDLER: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?MONICA: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.PHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.MONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.ROSS: Whoo!PHOEBE: Cool.MONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.ROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?CHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.ROSS: Come on.CHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!MONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.PHOEBE: So...Thank you.ROSS: Could you be less enthused?JOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--MONICA: Like?JOEY: Charity.MONICA: Charity?ROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.RACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.PHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.ROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.CHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.JOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.RACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.PHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.RACHEL: Me neither.JOEY: Me too.MONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?MONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.RACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?MONICA: You know what? You're right.PHOEBE: Fine.ROSS: Fine.JOEY: Fine.CHANDLER: Fine.RACHEL: Fine.MONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.ROSS: Chandler!CHANDLER: Yeah?ROSS: Geez! Are you ready?CHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.ROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?CHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.ROSS: Wow.CHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.(phone rings)ROSS: Still doing the screening thing?CHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.JADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.CHANDLER: Bob here.JADE: Oh, hi.CHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?JADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.CHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?JADE: Eh.CHANDLER: Eh?JADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.ROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.JADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?(at the concert)MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.CHANDLER: So, let's go.ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.(at Monica and Rachel's)JOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.PHOEBE: Ok. One.JOEY: Nooo.MONICA: That was amazing!ROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.CHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.ROSS: What guys?

Hey, how's his dad?MONICA: Uh, good.ROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.CHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.JOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.PHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?MONICA: No, I just, I fell down.RACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?MONICA: You know, a party, or--RACHEL: What party?ROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?MONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.RACHEL: Oh!PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?(Monica's pager goes off)MONICA: It's work.CHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.JOEY: And we don't work hard?MONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.CHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.JOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.CHANDLER: Yes.RACHEL: Oh!CHANDLER: No.MONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.PHOEBE: Oh.(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.JOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.JADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...(Joey lunges for phone and misses.)[Scene: At Monica and Rachel's.]MONICA: Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh?

All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)MONICA: There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)CHANDLER: Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)JOEY: Cool.MONICA: He hates me. My nephew hates me.ROSS: Come on, don't do this.MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.(Chandler has a basketball which he is moving closer to, then away from, Monica)JOEY: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that.

It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?MONICA: Jacket now.ROSS: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.CHANDLER: We'll watch him.ROSS: I don't think tho.JOEY: What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?CHANDLER: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.ROSS: Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.JOEY: Hat, milk, got it.ROSS: ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!JOEY: Consider it done.CHANDLER: You understood that?JOEY: Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.CHANDLER: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?(Central Perk)PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.RACHEL: Ok.PHOEBE: (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it.

I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?TERRY: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.RACHEL: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.TERRY: Uh--RACHEL: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?PHOEBE: (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.(Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben)CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.

What'd I tell you?CAROLINE: I think it's great you guys are doing this.CHANDLER: Well, we are great guys.CAROLINE: You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?(Central Perk)PHOEBE: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.PHOEBE: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.RACHEL: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. RACHEL: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.TERRY: I, I don't know. RACHEL: Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.TERRY: You don't clean the cappuccino machine?RACHEL: Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.TERRY: Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.RACHEL: Done.PHOEBE: Really?RACHEL: Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?PHOEBE: Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting.

No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.ROSS: Tho?(Monica shakes her head.)ROSS: Ohhh.MONICA: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?ROSS: Ok.MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!CHANDLER: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!JOEY: Hey, hey, look at that talent.CHANDLER: (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good.

Ben! Ben! CHANDLER: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.BOTH: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.DOCTOR: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.ROSS: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. PHOEBE: (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey.

Um, so does your guitar have a strap?STEPHANIE: No.PHOEBE: Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)CHANDLER: (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.RACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--PHOEBE: (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!RACHEL: Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.STEPHANIE: Thank you.

(Puts his arm around Joey)BOTH (but to different babies): Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!CHANDLER: Please tell me you know which one is our baby.JOEY: Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns.

Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.CHANDLER: Yeah?JOEY: Yeah.CHANDLER: Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.JOEY: Ahh!CHANDLER: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?JOEY: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.CHANDLER: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?JOEY: You got a better idea? CHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.JOEY: Heads.CHANDLER: Heads it is.JOEY: Yes! Whew!CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.JOEY: Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?(on the sidewalk outside Central Perk)RACHEL: Hey.PHOEBE: Oh, hi.RACHEL: Here. I thought you might be cold.PHOEBE: Thank you.RACHEL: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.RACHEL: Do you?PHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.RACHEL: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.RACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".PHOEBE: Really? From who?RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.KID: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!(chez Monica and Rachel)ROSS: I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.MONICA: That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.ROSS: Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?MONICA: Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?ROSS: Oh.MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?ROSS: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? MONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.ROSS: I hope Ben has a little sister.MONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.ROSS: I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?MONICA: That was you?ROSS: They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.MONICA: Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.CHANDLER: (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.(Ben starts crying)JOEY: Yes! There's still pie.ROSS: I'm here.

Come here.CHANDLER: Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!STEPHANIE: (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?PHOEBE: No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".STEPHANIE: Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...PHOEBE: Better. Yeah.STEPHANIE: Yeah?PHOEBE: Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.STEPHANIE: Yeah. PHOEBE: You wanna try it again?STEPHANIE: Yeah. From the top?PHOEBE: Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?STEPHANIE: Ok.PHOEBE: Mmmm hmmm.TOGETHER: Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.PHOEBE: That's too much. Sorry.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is sitting at the couches, Chandler enters.]CHAN: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough?

God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?MICH: Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."RACH: Closure, that's what it is. Closure.

So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.JOEY: Wow.PHOE: Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.JOEY: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.PHOE: Um-hum.JOEY: This man is my God.[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is closing up and Ross comes in. Get your Kleenex.]RACH: Hi.ROSS: I didn't get a cat.RACH: Oh, that's um, interesting.ROSS: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.RACH: Alright, I got it Ross.ROSS: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.RACH: [hurt] What?ROSS: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.RACH: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?ROSS: Then you should have said something before I met her.RACH: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.ROSS: There was never a good time.RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.ROSS: Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?ROSS: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.RACH: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?ROSS: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.RACH: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.ROSS: Fine.RACH: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.ROSS: Good.RACH: Good. [Ross leaves][Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.]RACH: And ya know what, now I've got closure.[Rachel slams the door and locks it. She sits down, visibly upset.

And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.PHOE: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?RACH: No, actually first they started on my waist.

Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide![Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's (RTST) office. Monica is there about a job.]RTST: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.MNCA: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.RTST: Mockolate.MNCA: I'm sorry?RTST: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.MNCA: Ohh.[He pulls out a piece of Mockolate.]RTST: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.MNCA: All right. Mmm-mmm.[She tastes it, and obviously hates it.]RTST: Yeah?MNCA: [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.RTST: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.MNCA: [still chewing] Mmm-mmm.RTST: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.MNCA: Wow.RTST: Aren't you going to swallow that?MNCA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.RTST: Yeah, isn't that great?MNCA: [with false enthusiasm] Mmm.RTST: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?MNCA: Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.RTST: Really?MNCA: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are there.

He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."PHOE: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is up in arms about the Rachel/Julie situation.]ROSS: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.CHAN: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.JOEY: Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]CHAN: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.JOEY: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.[Ross gives him an insulted look.]CHAN: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.ROSS: Can't we just use a pen?CHAN: No, Amish boy.JOEY: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.ROSS: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.JOEY: You could say that.ROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.CHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?ROSS: I don't know.JOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.CHAN: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?ROSS: [long pause] She's not Rachel.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica has made food for Phoebe and Rachel to taste.]MNCA: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.[Rachel takes a bite.]RACH: Oh my god.MNCA: Oh my god good?RACH: Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.[Rachel runs to the sink to spit it out.]PHOE: Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like![Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is on the phone with a computer hotline.]CHAN: I'm telling you this thing won't print.

Are you watching Star Trek?[Ross enters with a melancholy look.]JOEY: [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?ROSS: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me.

It's um the other thing.RACH: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?[Joey is looking at Rachel, smiling, and gesturing his head towards Ross.]ROSS: Well, uh.JOEY: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.RACH: Really?ROSS: Really. It's always been you, Rach.[Ross and Rachel hug.]RACH: Oh, god.JOEY/CHAN: Ohhh.RACH: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.ROSS: I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?RACH: Let me get my coat.ROSS: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.[Ross leaves.]RACH: Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's that?CHAN: [nervous] What? Nothing.[Chandler closes up the laptop computer screen.]RACH: What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?CHAN: No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey, rattled] Hey, it's printing![Chandler rips off the sheet of paper from the printer.]RACH: Well what is it? Let me see.[Ross walks back in, Rachel's coat in hand.]ROSS: Hey, someone order a coat?RACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.ROSS: He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?CHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.RACH: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.CHAN, JOEY, ROSS: No!RACH: Come on.JOEY: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?[Ross and Chandler stare angrily at Joey, who thinks he has come up with a good idea.]CHAN: [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."ROSS: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.RACH: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.ROSS: No, you don't.RACH: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]RACH: What is this? Ross, what is this?CHAN: Good luck.[Chandler and Joey leave quickly.]ROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?RACH: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?ROSS: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.RACH: Just a waitress?ROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?RACH: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles![Rachel leaves, and Ross follows her into the hall.]ROSS: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.RACH: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.[She goes into her apartment and slams the door.]ROSS: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]CHAN: My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.MNCA: You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.PHOE: I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.JOEY: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.PHOE: What?MNCA: What?CHAN: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.MNCA: This was your idea?PHOE: What were you thinking?CHAN: [squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.MNCA: Yeah. You!CHAN: All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?PHOE: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting on the couch, eating candy. It is raining out. Ross climbs up the fire escape and is knocking on the window.]ROSS: Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!RACH: [coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.ROSS: I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.RACH: Not interested.[Rachel closes the drapes over the window, goes into her bedroom and closes the door.]ROSS: [reading his list] Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.[Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter, confused.]ROSS: Number six: the way you smell.JOEY: [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?ROSS: Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?JOEY: Oh, yeah, I do.[He opens the window, Ross comes in, soaked.]CHAN: What are you doing out there?ROSS: I am, uh, I am...MNCA: Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?[Ross runs to Rachel's bedroom, knocking on the door.]ROSS: Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.[Rachel opens the door.]RACH: No.ROSS: No?RACH: That's what I said.CHAN: Look, maybe we should go?RACH: No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.ROSS: Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.RACH: [near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.ROSS: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.RACH: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!ROSS: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.RACH: Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.[She closes the door in his face. Ross walks sullenly back to the couch and sits down. A moment of silence ensues.]JOEY: [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer.[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]MNCA: Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.RTST: Doesn't matter.MNCA: What?RTST: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.MNCA: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.RTST: Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. [hands it to her] Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?MNCA: Well, uh, I ate some.RTST: Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are there.](phone rings)MNCA: Hello?[Ross is at his apartment.]ROSS: Hi.RACH: [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.MNCA: [to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.ROSS: Look, can, can you do something for me?MNCA: Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?[Monica turns on the radio.]RADIO: The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. (With or Without You plays)[Rachel seems touched. She pauses for a moment, then picks up the phone and starts to dial. Cut to Ross at his apartment.]RADIO: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]RTST: Hi, thanks for coming in again.MNCA: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.RTST: It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?MNCA: Cat hair.RTST: Oh, sorry.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, Ross, and Phoebe are there.

Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.CHANDLER: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?PHOEBE: Not especially.

My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.RACHEL: How have you never been on Oprah?PHOEBE: [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.MONICA: Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.PHOEBE: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]MONICA: Oh, wait a minute honey.GANG: Phoebs.

Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.GRANDMOTHER: Look, I. . .PHOEBE: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.PHOEBE: Oh God.GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?GRANDMOTHER: Honey.PHOEBE: [realizes] Oh.GRANDMOTHER: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this.

Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.PHOEBE: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.GRANDMOTHER: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.PHOEBE: Whattaya mean?GRANDMOTHER: He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

Well, at least my cup is half full.PHOE: Half full of looooovvvvve.MNCA: And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.PHOE: Cabin of loooooovvvvve.RACH: We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table, holding five empty wine bottles]MNCA: Really? I only had two glasses.JOEY: I just had a glass.PHOE: Two.RACH: I had one glass.CHAN: I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.RACH: OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?[All look towards door Fun Bobby left through.]ROSS: Oooooh.JOEY: [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.MNCA: So what. So he drank a lot tonight.ROSS: Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.PHOE: Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?MNCA: Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.[Scene: Monica, Fun Bobby, and Phoebe sitting in Central Perk Rachel is serving them. She brings a mug to Monica.]MNCA: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?RACH: Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.MNCA: [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.RACH: Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.FBOB: [pulls out a flask] Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?[Phoebe and Rachel look uncomfortable.]PHOE: Um, cake.RACH: Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]MNCA: You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.FBOB: Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.MNCA: Bobby.FBOB: Yeah, OK.MNCA: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.FBOB: OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'MNCA: So, what are you saying now?FBOB: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. [they hug]PHOE: [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?FBOB: I am gonna try and quit drinking.PHOE: [sad] Ooohh, why?[Chandler and Joey enter.]CHAN: Hey.JOEY: Hey.MNCA: Hey.PHOE: Hey.CHAN: Guess who's back in show business.PHOE: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?CHAN: No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.PHOE: Oh, no.CHAN: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.JOEY: Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!PHOE: Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.MNCA: [gasps] You have other friends?RACH: Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.MNCA: What?JOEY: With a man?RACH: What? What is so strange about me having a date?JOEY: What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?RACH: Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.MNCA: What are you talking about?RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.PHOE: But you guys came so close.RACH: Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.[Russ enters Central Perk. He looks like Ross, except for his chin and hair (it is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]RACH: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.RUSS: [sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.[Everyone looks at each other in amazement.][Scene: Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Estelle (ESTL) is speaking on the phone.]ESTL: Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? [a knock on the door] Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.[Joey enters.]ESTL: Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?JOEY: Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.ESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?JOEY: No.ESTL: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]JOEY: OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...ESTL: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?JOEY: Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? [pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. [hangs up] [to Joey] Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel at counter, Phoebe, Chandler, and Fun Bobby at the couch.]RACH: What's the matter?MNCA: It's Fun Bobby.RACH: What, isn't he sober?MNCA: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.RACH: Ohhh, OK.[Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]MNCA: Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]FBOB: Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?MNCA: Oh God, yes!FBOB: There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.PHOE: That is funny.FBOB: I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.MNCA: Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?FBOB: Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]CHAN: Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.MNCA: Oh.... my... God.PHOE: It's not that bad.MNCA: Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.MNCA: But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.PHOE: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.[Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]RUSS: Hi.CHAN: [turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!RACH: Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?RUSS: OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.[Phoebe walks up to Rachel, cleaning tables.]PHOE: Rachel? Um, hi.RACH: Hi.PHOE: OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?RACH: Uhh.... waitressing?PHOE: Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?RACH: [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?PHOE: [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.[Phoebe turns back around but Rachel is gone. Ross enters.]PHOE: Oh, my, oh!ROSS: What? What's wrong?PHOE: I, OK....MNCA: She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.ROSS: Alright.CHAN: [to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross] Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.RUSS: Hi.ROSS: Hi.RUSS: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?ROSS: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?RUSS: Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.ROSS: A date.RUSS: Yeah, I'm her date.ROSS: Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.CHAN: You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.RUSS: Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.ROSS: Yes, yes I am. And you are a....RUSS: Periodontist.MNCA: See? They're as different as night and... later that night.ROSS: Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.RUSS: Ditto.[ROss approaches Rachel at counter.]ROSS: I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.RACH: Oh.ROSS: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.RACH: Well, we're not seeing each other, so....ROSS: Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...RACH: Well, yeah, this is the deal.ROSS: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.RACH: Um, Russ, you ready?RUSS: Yeah.RACH: Bye.MNCA: Bye.PHOE: Bye.[Russ and Rachel leave together.]ROSS: [upset] She's dating. She's dating.CHAN: Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?ROSS: What do you mean?MNCA: Do you not see it?ROSS: See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.CHAN: Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?ROSS: ....................Yeah.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is making marinara sauce and filling every container in sight. Chandler enters.]CHAN: Hey.JOEY: Hey.CHAN: Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.JOEY: Well, the part's mine if I want it.CHAN: Oh my God!JOEY: Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.CHAN: [not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?JOEY: Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.CHAN: So, what're you gonna do?JOEY: Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?CHAN: Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.JOEY: I've never slept with someone for a part.CHAN: Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]JOEY: Sorry.CHAN: It's alright. Is she good-looking?JOEY: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.CHAN: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?JOEY: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.[Scene: A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.]WAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?MNCA: Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.FBOB: If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.MNCA: No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.FBOB: So the light went out in my refrigerator...MNCA: [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler is sitting on the couch between Russ and Ross, doing a crossword puzzle.]CHAN: Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.RUSS: Dysprosium.ROSS: [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.CHAN: And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.[Phoebe and Rachel are at the counter talking.]PHOE: You don't see it? You actually don't see it?RACH: What?PHOE: OK honey, you're dating Ross.RACH: No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.PHOE: Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!RACH: Steve... sleeve!PHOE: OK, noone is named Sleeve.RACH: Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.[They look over at Russ and Ross.]ROSS: [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.CHAN: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.RUSS: I know what your problem is.ROSS: Oh you do, do you?RUSS: Um-hum, you're jealous.ROSS: Of... of what?RUSS: You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.ROSS: Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.RUSS: Hey, you listen.ROSS: No, no, let me finish.RUSS: No, let me finish.ROSS: No, you let me fini...[Rachel walks up behind them.]ROSS: Hi.RUSS: Hi.RACH: Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away][Scene: Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Chandler at Monica and Rachel's apartment.]RACH: Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?CHAN: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?RACH: I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?CHAN: Me.RACH: Why would I have to sleep with you?CHAN: It's my game. You want the job or not?[Monica enters from her bedroom.]CHAN: Hey.MNCA: Morning.ROSS: Where ya goin'?MNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?ROSS: Ooooohhhh.[Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?ROSS: What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?MNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.[Three slow knocks on the door.]RACH: Oh God, even his knock is boring.[Monica answers the door. Its Fun Bobby.]MNCA: Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.FBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?MNCA: Sure.[They both step out into the hall.]FBOB: This is really hard for me to say.MNCA: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.FBOB: Oh, no, no, it's about you.MNCA: What about me?FBOB: I think you may have a drinking problem.MNCA: What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.FBOB: Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?MNCA: Oh... shoot.FBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.MNCA: OK.[They hug and kiss.]MNCA: Take care.FBOB: You too.[Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]RACH: What happened?MNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.GANG: Awwwwwwww.[Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, and Rachel all exchange money.]MNCA: [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?CHAN: I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.[Joey enters.]JOEY: Hey.GANG: Hey!ROSS: How'd the callback go?JOEY: It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.CHAN: So what'd you do?JOEY: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.ROSS: Good for you.JOEY: But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.PHOE: So... and?JOEY: Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!GANG: Allright!JOEY: Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves][Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.]Credits [Scene: Central Perk. Russ enters. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]RUSS: Hi.CHAN: Oh, hey.PHOE: Hi.RUSS: I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.CHAN: Yeah, I'm sorry man.RUSS: Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?[Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]PHOE: Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.RUSS: Oh.[Julie... Ross's ex-girlfriend... enters.]JULIE: Hey.CHAN: Hey!PHOE: Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?JULIE: Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....[Russ and Julie look at each other with love in their eyes. The music builds...][at Ross's. Carol and Susan are picking Ben up]ROSS: Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!CAROL: So how did everything go?ROSS: Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.CAROL: Well, we've gotta go.ROSS: Ok.SUSAN: [clears her throat]CAROL: Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.ROSS: Oh, you and me?CAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.SUSAN: The other us.ROSS: Ok.CAROL: We're uh, we're getting married.ROSS: As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?CAROL: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.ROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.CAROL: Look I just thought that...ROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!SUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?ROSS: Mmm hmmm.CAROL: Want us to go?ROSS: Uh-huh.[at Rachel and Monica's]ROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.JOEY: It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..MONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.ROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY: Yes!MONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?ROSS: Would it matter?MONICA: Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!JOEY: Are you really not going?ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?MONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.CHANDLER: [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.MONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.RACHEL: [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?JOEY: No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.CHANDLER: Whoa, she's pretty.JOEY: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.RACHEL: I'm sorry, what?MONICA: What?JOEY: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.CHANDLER: Oh, ok.JOEY: There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.MRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?JOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.CHANDLER: Nice!RACHEL: That's great!ROSS: Excellent!CHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.[Monica and Rachel's]ROSS: That is so good! Do it again!JOEY: All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"CHANDLER: That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.ROSS: No no, that's me.CHANDLER: Oh, yeah.ROSS: Oh, hello.PHOEBE: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...ROSS: Is everything ok?PHOEBE: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.ROSS: Oh my god.CHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.PHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.MONICA: Oh, honey.PHOEBE: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.RACHEL: What do you mean?PHOEBE: I think it went into me.[Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe][Central Perk]MONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.RACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?ROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.CHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?RACHEL: Oh god.JOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.RACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?PHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!MRS. GREEN: [entering] There she is.RACHEL: Mom!MRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.RACHEL: Pretty much.MRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.RACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.MRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross.ROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]MRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?RACHEL: Oh Mom!MRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.CHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.MRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.RACHEL: Really?MRS GREEN: Yes.PHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.JOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?PHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?[at Rachel and Monica'sMRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.RACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.MRS GREEN: [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.RACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?MRS GREEN: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.RACHEL: For...me.MRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.RACHEL: Well, what do you mean?MRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.MONICA: [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.ROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?RACHEL: None.JOEY: They didn't fight a lot?RACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.JOEY: Hey, look who's up.RACHEL: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.MONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.RACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.PHOEBE: That's him.CHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.MR A: Phoebe?PHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.MR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.PHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?MR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?PHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.MR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?PHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?MR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.PHOEBE: Everything?MR A: Everything.PHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.MR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.PHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.MR A: [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?[Joey nods and shrugs.]MRS GREEN: Look at this.RACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.MRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?RACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.MONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?RACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."MONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.RACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?MONICA: If you want.PHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.RACHEL: She's still with you?PHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?RACHEL: God!MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?MRS GREEN: No.RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?MRS GREEN: No.RACHEL: Then what? What do you want?MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this?MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.RACHEL: Oh.MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left.

No sir!MONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.[knock at the door]MONICA: Hi.CAROL: How's it going?MONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule.

I think we're calling off the wedding.ROSS: What?MONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.ROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?CAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.ROSS: Oh my god.CAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.ROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.CAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.ROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.CAROL: You do?ROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.CAROL: Of course I do.ROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.CAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.MONICA: So we're back on?CAROL: We're back on.MONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.[at the wedding]JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?

The world is my lesbian wedding.[Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one?

Go, go.[At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture taken.]MONICA: Would you look at them?ROSS: Yeah, can't help but.JOEY: [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.PHOEBE: I miss Rose.CHANDLER: Oh, yeah?PHOEBE: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.WOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?PHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice.[Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe doesn't see him.]CHANDLER: [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]RACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?MRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet.

[MonkeyShine theme] MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.][Camera pans back from the TV to show the gang watching.]ROSS: That commercial always makes me so sad.JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.CHANDLER: Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.OPENING TITLES [Scene: Central Perk.

Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.ROSS: Zoo dollars?LIPSON: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.

Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.RACHEL: Oh my God.MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.ROB: You OK?PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups.

Monica is wearing her costume, including big fake breasts.]MONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.ALL: Ohhh.MONICA: What?ROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?MONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?JOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?ROSS: Yeah.PHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.MONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts]MONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.CHANDLER: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.OPENING TITLES[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are planning Rache's birthday party.]ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.MONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.PHOEBE: Why not her?JOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.MONICA: Joey that is horriable.JOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.JOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.[Rachel enters]ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.CHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.RACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.MONICA: So what happened?RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.PHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.MONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?CHANDLER: Why her mom?MONICA: Cause I already invited her.PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?JOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are setting up for the party.]PHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles.

Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.[knock at the door]MONICA: [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?MR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?MONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.MR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.MONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.MR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?CHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?[knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Greene]MRS. GREENE: Hi Monica.[Monica slams the door back shut]MONICA: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.CHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy.JOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.MR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]MRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?MONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.MRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?CHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.PHOEBE: And because you're both, you know, white women.MRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?CHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.MRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink coat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... [Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]PHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.CHANDLER: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?JOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.MONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.CHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?MONICA: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.JOEY: Right this is staging.CHANDLER: Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.JOEY: [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.[Back in Chandler and Joey's party]ROSS: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?MR. GREENE: It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.ROSS: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job.

She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?CHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.RACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.CHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?RACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...CHANDLER: I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.][Scene: Monica's party. She is seeing off the last of the guests.]MONICA: Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.MRS. GREENE: Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

GREENE: I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.PHOEBE: Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.JOEY: Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene.

[He licks it and offers it to her.]MONICA: [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.CHANDLER: That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.MONICA: [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.[Chandler is visibly upset]RACHEL: You went out with a guy in the Navy?PHOEBE: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park.

Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.[He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]RICHARD: Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?MONICA: Baddest.

You know what, the way you did it was just fine.RICHARD: Then, you're redoing it because...MONICA: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.RICHARD: You're pretty much running that risk either way.MONICA: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.RICHARD: Oh, well that's not so crazy.MONICA: I'm just easing you in.RICHARD: Oh, alright.MONICA: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms?

Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.RYAN: Why aren't you at home in bed?PHOEBE: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.RYAN: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.PHOEBE: Ohh, ohh.RYAN: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.PHOEBE: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.RYAN: Can I please see your face?PHOEBE: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.RYAN: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.RYAN: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.PHOEBE: I hate this.

I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her and kisses her.]PHOEBE: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.[Scene: Chandler's office.

I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.CHANDLER: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?JOEY: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?CHANDLER: Weird world. Your kids?JOEY: I figure my character has kids.CHANDLER: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.JOEY: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.CHANDLER: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.JOEY: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.CHANDLER: Really? Wow.

(Rachel looks at him in disbelief) Or you just do it.JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.MONICA: Then what's the problem?JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.

And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.RACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!BARRY: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?RACHEL: (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

Your taking a big leap there...Janice: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.Joey: But what does that gonna do...Janice: For Chandler!Joey: Okay. I'm in.Janice: Okay. All right.

Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.Chandler: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.Joey: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.Chandler: What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?Joey: Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)Chandler: He's got nothing!Phoebe: (entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay, I'm ready.Ross and Chandler: Oh, aaaah!Phoebe: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'Chandler: What are you supporting?Phoebe: Duh!! Christmas!Ross: Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.

But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?Rachel: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?Ross: Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.Rachel: But I...Ross: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.Rachel: All right.Ross: Thank you!Monica: (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.Ross: It was, it was her voice.Chandler: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.Michelle: Hola! Hello. Hello?Monica: Okay. That was her right?Phoebe: Definitely.Monica: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.Ross: Yay!(phone rings)Phoebe: I'll get it, okay.

You should get that.Monica: (on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....Chandler: (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?Monica: (on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.Ross: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.Monica: Okay, fine. (runs to her room)Chandler: They got a phone in there, right?Phoebe: Okay, we're on it. We're on it.(Rachel comes out from her room wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt)Ross: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo.Ross: You're not going to go.Rachel: No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.Ross: How, how, um how can you not be going?Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.Ross: Um, you know, just out of curiosity...Rachel: Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.Ross: Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.Rachel: It's fine.Ross: No, but, your-your mad.Rachel: I'm not mad.Ross: No.Rachel: I'm just not going.Ross: Your not going.Rachel: Right.Ross: Okay. You know that I-I have to go.Rachel: Um, hum.Ross: Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'Rachel: No.Ross: No, because your not upset.Rachel: Right.Ross: About the yelling.Rachel: Right, and the humiliating.Ross: Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.Rachel: Um, hum.Ross: We're good.Rachel: Right.Ross: Okay. Honey?Rachel: Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)Ross: I love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)Phoebe: (yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.Chandler: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?(Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)Joey: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.Chandler: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!Joey: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...Chandler: Oooo-ooh!Joey: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)Ross: Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!Chandler: Jeez, what a baby.Joey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.Ross: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.Joey: You could drink the fat.Ross: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.Rachel: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.Ross: What?Rachel: I think you should drink the fat.Joey: Yaaaay!Ross: Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.Phoebe: Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.Ross: I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him just before he starts drinking)Rachel: No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!Ross: You will?!Rachel: You were really gonna do that, weren't you?Ross: Well, yeah.Rachel: You were gonna drink the fat.Joey: Let's see what else he'll do!Ross: (to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed!

Monica!(Joey and Chandler start to leave, Joey is lunging as he is walking)Chandler: Stop it. Stop it!(Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)Phoebe: Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!Richard: (on machine) Hi, this is Richard.Machine: You have three new messages.Monica: Not any more!Machine: Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.Monica: Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.Machine: Your outgoing message has now been changed.Monica: Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!Monica: (on machine) "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!Phoebe: How did you do that?Monica: I don't know!Machine: Good-bye.Monica: Noooo!!!!Ross: (entering) Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!Monica: Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.Phoebe: Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.Ross: Rachel!! (she enters) Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!Rachel: And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that was about seven seconds.Ross: So we're a little late.Rachel: Come on.

Fruit?Rachel: Monica's making jam.Joey: Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?Chandler: Because the kids need new shoes.Monica: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)Joey: This will just be my batch.[Scene: Street, Phoebe is being followed by some guy, as they pass a flower vendor. Phoebe turns around and the guy quickly picks up some flowers and continues following her.]Phoebe: (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.Guy: You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....Phoebe: What?Guy: One more chance Ursula, please?Phoebe: Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.Guy: Wh..Phoebe: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.Guy: Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!Phoebe: Oh, you're not a dingus.Guy: I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.Phoebe: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.Guy: Well thanks. (starts to leave)Phoebe: Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?Guy: Not really.Phoebe: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.Guy: Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)Phoebe: Oh, thanks a lot.

(they fall onto the couch)(Chandler enters and they both jump up and pretend that Ross is showing her something in the couch.)Ross: There it is.Rachel: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.Ross: Hey.Chandler: Do I look fat?Ross and Rachel: Noo.Chandler: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.Rachel: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.Chandler: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?Rachel: Nooo!Ross: And it works both ways.Chandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?Rachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.Ross: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?Chandler: That's easy, baggage claim.Ross: (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.Chandler: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.Rachel: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.Ross: Oh.Rachel: All right are you guys gonna come down?Ross: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.Rachel: Good luck Chandler.Chandler: Thank you Rachel.Ross: Bye sweetie.Rachel: Bye hon.Ross: (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.Chandler: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.Ross: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...Chandler: Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)Ross: I'm gonna use the cushion.Chandler: Yeah.Ross: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.Chandler: Okay, the old hug and roll.Ross: Yep.Chandler: Okay, one question.Ross: Shoot.Chandler: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam]Joey: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?Rachel: (Looks at him) You're so pretty.Phoebe: (entering) Hi!All: Hey, Phoebe.Phoebe: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.Joey: (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?Phoebe: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.Chandler: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.Phoebe: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.Ross: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.Phoebe: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.Joey: (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)Phoebe: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.Monica: (entering) Hey guys.All: Hey Mon.Monica: Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.Joey: Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!Chandler: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)Joey: Put your hands together.Monica: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.Joey: No more jam?!Rachel: Well, what happened to your jam plan?Monica: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.Chandler: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.Ross: What are you talking about?Monica: I'm talking about me having a baby.Ross: What?Rachel: Are you serious?Monica: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.Ross: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!Monica: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.Chandler: That, that's what's stupid.Monica: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.Rachel: Down at the docks again?[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling]Janice: Night-night Bing-a-ling.Chandler: Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)Commercial Break[Scene: Central Perk, Malcom is giving Phoebe all of his spy stuff]Malcom: Here's my binoculars.Phoebe: Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.Malcom: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.Phoebe: Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)Malcom: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?Phoebe: Um, not even a little bit.Malcom: It's about you.Phoebe: Oh, okay then.Malcom: (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.Phoebe: Good. So what were you thinking?Malcom: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.Phoebe: Really?Malcom: No.Phoebe: Oh.Malcom: See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.Phoebe: Oh, okay. (he kisses her)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and Chandler is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.]Chandler: No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.Monica: (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.Chandler: You mean there's more than one of us.Ross: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....Monica: You're gonna what?Ross: I'm gonna tell Mom.Rachel: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.Ross: Crazy.Monica: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....Ross: (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...Monica: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?Joey: Check it out!! Jam crackers!Monica: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'Joey: Yeah, the Knicks rule!Monica: Joey, this is you!Joey: Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.Rachel: When did you go to a sperm bank?Joey: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?Chandler: And that's how you bought it?Joey: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.Monica: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.Joey: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.Phoebe: (entering) Hellooo!All: Hey.Ross: How's the maniac?Phoebe: Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.Rachel: Phoebe, what are you doing?Phoebe: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.Rachel: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.Phoebe: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.Ross: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?Phoebe: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?Chandler: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.Phoebe: What are you saying I should do?Monica: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.Phoebe: Thank you, Monica.Joey: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.Monica: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.[Scene: Central Perk]Rachel: Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)Janice: Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!Rachel: Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.Janice: Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.Rachel: (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?Janice: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.[Scene: Subway station, Phoebe is following Malcom by finding behind the pillars until she comes up to one with a wire mesh garbage can next to it.

(Ursula walks past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)Phoebe: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?Malcom: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.Phoebe: No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while.

I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.Monica: Really, is he a swimmer?Joey: He's got the body for it.Monica: I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?Joey: You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.Monica: We do not have one of those signs.Joey: Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.Monica: Two girls and a boy?Joey: Yeah!Monica: And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck.

(to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.Joey: (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.(They all start laughing at him)Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Janice are sitting on the couch, and Phoebe is sitting next to them in the chair.]Chandler: Well, it's official there are no good movies.Janice: Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean back into Monica.)Monica: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.Joey: (entering) Hey!Phoebe: Hey.Chandler: Hey, man. What's up?Joey: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!Chandler: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.Phoebe: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was me!Joey: How is it you?Phoebe: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him her hand)Joey: Yep, that's my audition.Monica: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.Phoebe: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.Janice: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.Joey: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.Phoebe: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.Joey: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.Phoebe: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing).Joey: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?Phoebe: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'Joey: Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)Phoebe: (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'Chandler: Is anybody else scared?Phoebe: (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)Chandler: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!Monica: Oh, now you want a pad.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben]Carol and Susan: (entering) Hey!!Ross: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?Carol: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.Susan: He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.Ross: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?Susan: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.Carol: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?Ross: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.(cut to later in the day)Ross: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)Rachel: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll? (uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)Monica: (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?Joey: I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)Monica: There it is. Joey, what are you doing?Joey: I'm sorry, it just felt nice.Chandler: (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.Joey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.Chandler: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.Rachel: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?Chandler: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.Ross: And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?Chandler: Noo.Ross: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.Chandler: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'Rachel: Men are unbelievable.Monica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?Chandler: I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.Monica: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.Joey: Hey, you know about that?!Chandler: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!(Joey looks quizzically at Ross)Ross: (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.Chandler: Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?Joey: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.Rachel: Amazingly, that makes sense.Chandler: You think?Joey: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!Chandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe's beeper is going off]Phoebe: Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?Rachel: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.Joey: Come on baby, come on!Phoebe: (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'Rachel: Very nice touch.Phoebe: (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a tunnel.Rachel: Unbelievable.Joey: Thank you so much.Phoebe: It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.Joey: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.Phoebe: Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.Joey: Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.Phoebe: Two?Joey: Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.Phoebe: Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, rightJoey: Nooo, four.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Janice are having dinner]Janice: So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?Chandler: 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)Janice: Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.Chandler: Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.Janice: Oh, you didn't have to do this.Chandler: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.Janice: Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.Chandler: Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.Janice: We should?Chandler: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!Janice: (laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?Chandler: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.Janice: You probably want us to move in together?Chandler: It doesn't scare me!Janice: Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)Chandler: Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.

Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?Chandler: She said she'd call me.Rachel and Monica: Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)Chandler: Oh God.Monica: Welcome to our side of the tunnel.Chandler: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.Rachel: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.Monica: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.Rachel: Yeah, you do.Chandler: So, you don't think I'm terminal?Monica: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.Chandler: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?Rachel and Monica: Nooo!Rachel: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.Monica: She has to know that your not ready.Rachel: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.Chandler: So I'm not, not gonna lose her?Rachel: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.Chandler: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'Rachel: Oh.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is still trying to get Ben to play with something other than the Barbi doll.]Ross: Guess who's here.

They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.Joey: It's okay, these things happen.Phoebe: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.Joey: I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)Phoebe: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.Joey: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.Phoebe: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.Joey: They actually said that?Phoebe: Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...Joey: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.Phoebe: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.Ross: (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!!

How've you been?Janice: Are you being British?!Chandler: (normal voice) No. Not anymore.Janice: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?Chandler: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)Janice: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?Chandler: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.Janice: Where is this party?Chandler: Here in Chelsea.Janice: Who's party is it?Chandler: A woman'sJanice: What woman?!Chandler: (shyly) Chelsea.Janice: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? (another guy walks by)Chandler: Can I be that guy?[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are there]Phoebe: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.Joey: Okay, shoot.Phoebe: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.Joey: I didn't get it?Phoebe: No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.'

Sorry. (she starts to leave)Joey: Wait a minute.Phoebe: What?Joey: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.Phoebe: (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.Joey: (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is laying on the counter and Rachel and Monica are comforting him again.]Chandler: ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.Monica: My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.Chandler: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?Rachel: Yeah, it is.Monica: You know what, everything's gonna be okay.(phone rings)Chandler: (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?Rachel: Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.Monica: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.Rachel: Yeah.Chandler: Hello!Monica: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.Rachel: Yes, and grumpy.Chandler: What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately.

When are those gonna become extinct?Chandler: If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.Gunther: What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.(Joey is singing in his head.)Phoebe: Who’s singing?Opening Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there including Janice, they’re watching Happy Days.]Ross: Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.Monica: I was always Joanne.Joey: Question.

It’s the Mattress King!Joey: Booo!!Chandler: (to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!Janice: Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.Matress King: (on TV) ‘Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I’m so depressed I’m going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I’m going medieval on prices!Chandler: What a wank!Janice: Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.Monica: I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m appalled for you by the way.Matress King: (on TV) I’m close. I’m cheap. I’m the king.[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is on the phone, everyone else is there except Joey.]Rachel: ‘Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night.

Sorry.Rachel: Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.Ross: Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.Rachel: But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.Chandler: (leaning in) I’ll go.Ross: Fine.Rachel: Thank you.Ross: Hi Gunther.Gunther: Yeah, we’ll see!Joey: (entering) Hey, you guys!Phoebe: Hey!Joey: Guess what?Ross: What?Joey: I got a gig!All: Yay!!Chandler: See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.Phoebe: Yeah, I can’t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!Monica: What’s the part?Joey: Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.Ross: Come on! That’s great.All: Wow!Joey: Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.Ross: Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.Joey: (glares at him) I know![Scene: Mattress King, Monica and Phoebe are shopping for a new mattress.]Phoebe: Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.Monica: Not at these prices.Phoebe: (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!Monica: (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.Phoebe: Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.[Scene: Classroom. Joey is writing his name on the board, but turns around before he’s done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then underlines it, and draws the line right through his name.]Joey: Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Phoebe is already there waiting for the delievery guy.]Joey: Hi!Phoebe: Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?Joey: Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’Phoebe: Ooooh, nice.Joey: Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.Phoebe: Oh, yay!Joey: Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.(There is a knock on the door.)Phoebe: Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)Guy: Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to Phoebe) You Miss Geller?Phoebe: Okay.Guy: Sign here.

All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)Joey: Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.Phoebe: Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.Joey: Ahh!(Joey throws a punch and just lightly taps her on the shoulder, Phoebe counters with a jab to the nose.)Joey: Hey now!(Phoebe throws another jab, and lands it on Joey’s nose, causing it to bleed.)Joey: Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh!Joey: Okay, great.Phoebe: Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.Joey: Okay.Phoebe: ‘Kay, put your head back.Joey: All right. I can’t see.Phoebe: All right, I have ya. Oh God.Guy: Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?Phoebe: Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.Guy: Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)[Scene: Restaurant, Rachel and Ross and Dr. Green are having dinner.]Rachel: Hi Daddy!Dr. Green: This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.Rachel: You remember Ross.Dr. Green: Um-hmm.Ross: Nice to see you again Dr. Green.Dr. Green: So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is successful.) (to Ross) How’s the library?Ross: Ugh, museum.Dr. Green: What happened to the library?Ross: There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.Dr. Green: You know what’s really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.Ross: Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.Rachel: Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.Dr. Green: What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.Ross: It’s not a library...Dr. Green: (interrupting him) I know!! It’s a museum! What, you’re the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don’t know to the waiter.)[Scene: After dinner.]Ross: So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.Dr. Green: They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?Ross: It gives it a nice antiquey look.Dr. Green: (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.Ross: Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)Dr. Green: Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.Rachel: Okay.Ross: Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)Rachel: Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.Ross: Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.Rachel: Yeah. That’s Daddy.Ross: That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.Rachel: Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.Ross: So?Rachel: So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.Ross: You really serve people sneezers?Rachel: Well um, I don’t.Dr Green: You kids ready?Ross: Thanks again, Dr. Green.Dr. Green: All right.(Ross takes a twenty and slips it underneath the bill when Dr. Green isn’t looking.)Dr. Green: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.Ross: Oh, ah, you don’t need that.Dr. Green: Why not?Ross: The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.Dr. Green: (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?Ross: Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.Rachel: Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.Ross: I know.Dr. Green: Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?Rachel: Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.Ross: Nothing I do means anything, really.Dr. Green: This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)Ross: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.[Scene: Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]Joey: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.Student: Hey, Mr. Trib.Joey: Hey-hey.Student: Guess what, I got an audition!Joey: Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.Student: I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?Joey: You bet! What’s the part?Student: Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.(Joey does the ‘232 divided by 13 bad news’ look.)Commercial Break[Scene: Hallway, Ross and Rachel are returning from dinner.]Rachel: You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.Ross: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.Rachel: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.Ross: Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.(they go into Monica and Rachel’s, and see Phoebe hopping around.)Ross: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?Phoebe: I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?Rachel: Um. yeah.Phoebe: I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room)Rachel: All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.Ross: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.Rachel: Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.Ross: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’Rachel: Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?Ross: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.Rachel: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)Ross: Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels.[Scene: Monica’s bedroom, Phoebe is trying to hide the bed from Monica.]Monica: (sees the bed) What’s this?Phoebe: Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!Monica: This is not the bed I ordered!Phoebe: I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!(Phoebe starts to make a sound like a car accelerating)Monica: Phoebe!(Phoebe makes a sound like a car screeching to a halt.)Monica: Why is this car in my bedroom?Phoebe: I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...Monica: When did I sign for it?Phoebe: When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!Monica: Did you make brownies today?Chandler: Knock, knock.Monica: (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.Chandler: Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.Phoebe: It’s Monica’s bed. What?Chandler: Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.Phoebe: So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?Chandler: Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?Monica: Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)[Scene: Classroom, Joey is coaching his student.]Student: Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.Joey: Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?Student: No.Joey: Whoa. That was really good.Student: Thanks, any suggestions?(Joey gets the evil look on his face.)[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there, yelling at Joey.]Chandler: You told him to play the boxer gay!!Joey: Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.Chandler: You totally screwed him over.Monica: Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?Joey: Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.Phoebe: Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is greeting her Father for their brunch.]Rachel: (opening the door) Hi Daddy.Dr. Green: Baby.

Swim here?Ross: (to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.Rachel: What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.Ross: Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)Rachel: What?!Ross: Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....Dr. Green: Ross? What’s with the neck?Rachel: He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...Dr. Green: You’re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn’t get into medical school in Extapa!Ross: Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.Rachel: Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.Ross: Uh.Dr. Green: Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?Rachel: Well that’s his last name.Ross: And his first name.Dr. Green: He’s Bobby Bobby?Rachel: It’s Robert Bobby.Dr. Green: Oh.Rachel: And um, excuse me, he helps me.Ross: Oh-ho please.

(to Ross) Her legs are fine!Ross: I know that!Dr. Green: So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?Rachel: I’m sorry, let her?Ross: What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.Dr. Green: Wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!Rachel: No.Dr. Green: Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!(Both he and Ross start laughing)Ross: Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?Dr. Green: I’d love some juice. Thanks.Ross: Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?Rachel: Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.Ross: Excellent![Scene: Classroom, Joey is talking to his students.]Joey: (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.[Scene: Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed.]Jester: Uh, may I help you?Monica: Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.Jester: Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.Joey: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.Jester: Nobody sees the king!Joey: Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)Jester: Hey! You can’t go back there!(Joey goes to the door, but stops and looks through the window at Janice and the Mattress King, her ex-husband, kissing.)Janice: Oh my God.(Joey fakes a scream.)Closing Credits[Scene: Monica’s bedroom, Chandler is playing with the bed.]Chandler: Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there, Rachel is serving brownies.]Rachel: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?Chandler: I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)(Phoebe takes a bite and spits it out and screams.)Chandler: Okay, I’m not gonna have one.Ross: Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)Phoebe: No, no, it’s just my tooth.Chandler: All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)Ross: So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.Phoebe: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.Chandler: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.Ross: Why? Why can’t you go to him?Phoebe: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.Chandler: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.Rachel: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.Rachel: And all these people actually died?Phoebe: Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!Ross: Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.Phoebe: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]Ross: Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?Gunther: Oh, like you don’t already have everything.Phoebe: (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)Rachel: Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.Phoebe: All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.Rachel: I promise.Phoebe: Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.Joey: (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?Ross: (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s not.Monica: You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.Ross: What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?Joey: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.Rachel: Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.Joey: It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.Phoebe: Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, All are there except for Chandler.]Joey: (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.

(starts to cry and runs out)Ross: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.Joey: What did they do?Ross: Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.Monica: So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?Ross: Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.Rachel: Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?Ross: You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)Joey: Hey-hey, Ross?Ross: Yeah.Joey: I’ve got a science question.Ross: Hmm?Joey: If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?Ross: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.Joey: Hey-hey, I’m not judging.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are babysitting Ben.]Rachel: (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon.

(takes Ben) We’re gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits Ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)[cut to later]Monica: (to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are, you’re so brave.Rachel: Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!Monica: He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.Rachel: We’re not?!Monica: No we’re not.Rachel: All right, I like that.Monica: Okay.Rachel: So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump, there’s a bump.Monica: Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!Rachel: I cannot push it in!Monica: Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.Rachel: Okay, okay, okay.Monica: I got it!Rachel: Okay.Monica: The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!Rachel: Or. We could put a hat on his head.Monica: A hat! Yes! We need a hat.Rachel: We need a hat..Monica: Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?Rachel: Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)Monica: Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.)

Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.Chandler: That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.Joey: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.Chandler: All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever.

Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.Janice: Why are your eyes so white?Chandler: You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex!

Everyone.Rachel: Hi!Ross: How’s my little boy?Rachel: He’s perfect, he’s never been better.Ross: (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?Ben: Monica.Ross: Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.Ben: Monica bang!Monica: Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.Phoebe: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.Joey: Uh.Phoebe: What?Joey: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]Phoebe: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.Rachel: Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.Joey: I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.Monica: All right, we should call somebody.Ross: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.Rachel: Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.Monica: How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.Joey: Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.]Joey: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?Chandler: Yeah.Joey: Well, now we got a reason.Chandler: What?Joey: Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.Chandler: All right.Joey: Hey uh, what’s a matter?Chandler: I talked to Janice.Joey: Oh my God, is she going back to him?Chandler: She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!Joey: What are you ah, what are you gonna do?Chandler: I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?Joey: Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.Chandler: Come on, tell me.Joey: All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.Chandler: What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?Joey: They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is entering from Rachel’s room.]Ross: Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?Rachel: Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.Ross: It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.Rachel: (confidently) I did!Ross: I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.Rachel: I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!Ross: Monica did it?(Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace.)Ross: Monica?Monica: Yeah.Ross: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?Monica: No. Why?Ross: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.Monica: Really?!Ross: Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle)Monica: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)Rachel: I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.Monica: (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)Ross: Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!Rachel: I’ll get the hat.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.]Chandler: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.Janice: Okay.Chandler: I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.Janice: Wow!Chandler: Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.Janice: Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.Chandler: Then don’t leave me!Janice: What?Chandler: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!Janice: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.Chandler: No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.Janice: (standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)Chandler: Ohhh. Don’t go.Janice: No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’t let her go.)Chandler: No. No! No! No!Janice: Honey, honey, people are looking.Chandler: I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don’t care!!Janice: Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of Chandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)Chandler: You can’t leave! I have your shoe!Janice: Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)Gunther: Rachel has those in burgendy.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the giant poking device.]Joey: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.Ross: Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!Phoebe: I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.Joey: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.(They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs.)Phoebe: He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!Monica: And yet, we’re still poking him.Joey: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.Ross: He does not look happy.Rachel: Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.Joey: Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!Closing Credits[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is listening to a Lionel Richie album]Chandler: (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....Phoebe: (joining him) Love....Chandler and Phoebe: I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I don’t mind.Chandler: (high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.Chandler and Phoebe: Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...Chandler: I know.Phoebe: I know.Chandler: I’ve found.Phoebe: I’ve found....Chandler and Phoebe: ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless love. (once again they don’t match tones, and they just look at each other)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there, the guys are watching football, the girls are cooking Thanksgiving dinner.]The Guys: (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!Phoebe: Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.The Guys: We will. (they don’t move)Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.(Rachel sticks a marshmellow into Monica’s nose. Monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)Monica: Every year.Opening Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]Phoebe: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).Ross: Halftime.Joey: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?Rachel: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.Chandler: No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.Chandler: That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!Joey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.Chandler: Yeah, all right, I’ll play.Phoebe: Yay!!Rachel: Let’s do it! Ross?Ross: What?Rachel: Do you wanna play football?Ross: Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.Joey: Says who? Your mom?Monica and Ross: Yeah.Monica: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.Monica: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.Ross: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.Monica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.Monica: (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?Ross: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.Chandler: And was the curse lifted?Ross: Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.Monica: Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.Ross: Can I see you for a second?(they walk over to the sink and discuss it for a moment)Monica: (shouting) Once!!Ross: All right, we’re gonna play.Chandler: But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.[Scene: The Park, the gang is warming up for their football game.]Monica: Okay. Let’s bring it in.Rachel: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.Ross: Here you go. (throws her the ball)Rachel: (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.Chandler: And then Tineals.Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?Monica: Well, why don’t we just bunny up.Rachel, Chandler, and Joey: What?Monica and Ross: (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!Monica: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.Joey: Thank you.Rachel: Monica, I’m your best friend.Ross: Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.Rachel: Ross!Monica: Phoebe.(Phoebe kisses Rachel on the cheek, then joins her team.)Ross: Sweetie, now I pick you.Rachel: You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!Ross: Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right.

Why don’t you stick around. You can sit right there.(she goes and sits down)Chandler: Well, that went well.Joey: I think so.Chandler: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.Joey: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.Chandler: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.Joey: Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.Chandler: Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean?

Hut! Hike!(Chandler runs around behind Ross, who pitches him the ball. Chandler runs upfield, and Joey knocks the ball out of his hands.)Joey: Fumble!(Joey starts to return the fumble and Chandler grabs Joey’s shirt and rips it off of his back.)Joey: What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.Chandler: Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.Joey: All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it.

Like the turkey, Ross is done!Ross: It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.Monica: You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.(Ross makes a ‘Yeah. Right.’ sound.)Monica: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.Ross: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.Monica: Oh, then bring it on!

He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.][cut to the girls huddle]Monica: All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.Rachel: No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.Monica: Honey, there’s a reason.Rachel: God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.Phoebe: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.Monica: All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.Rachel: Thank you! Break!Monica: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!(Phoebe snaps the ball to Monica, who pitches back to Rachel.)The Guys: One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!(They all rush toward Rachel, who panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)Rachel: I’m so sorry! Are you okay?Monica: No! I’m not okay!Rachel: I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.Joey: (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!Chandler: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!Monica: Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!Phoebe: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.Monica: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.Rachel: (on the verge of tears) Okay.Monica: Break!(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see flying through the air, and then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the grace of Jerry Rice (no offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. Both Phoebe and Monica erupt in celebration.)Rachel: (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!Chandler: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.(they all start to dive for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)Ross: Let go! Let go!Monica: Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!Chandler: Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!Monica: Ow!!Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are eating Thanksgiving dinner.]Rachel: We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.Phoebe: Isn’t there a national football league.Chandler: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.Rachel: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.Phoebe: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?Joey: When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.[Scene: The park, it’s dark outside and Monica and Ross are still fighting over the ball.]Monica: Let go!Ross: No! You let go!Monica: No!Ross: How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?Monica: I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.(It starts snowing.)Ross: Hey! It’s starting to snow.(They both look up, and watch it start to snow. Then they both start fighting for the ball again.)Ross: Gimme the this!Monica: Let go![Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]Chandler: (reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.Rachel: What?Chandler: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?Gunther: Rachel?Rachel: Yeah.Gunther: Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?Rachel: Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?Gunther: (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.Rachel: (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?Chandler: (thinks about it) Yeah?Opening Credits[Scene: The hallway of Ross’s building, there is a Brown Bird girl selling cookies, as Ross and Chandler come up the stairs.]Sarah: So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call, then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird flapping it’s wings.)Ross: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.Chandler: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.Ross: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.Chandler: I was shrieking... like a Marine.(they both start up the stairs.)Ross: All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)[Scene: Central Perk, the gang’s all there discussing the incident.]Monica: You broke a little girl’s leg?!!Ross: I know. I feel horrible. Okay.Chandler: (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?Ross: Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?Monica: Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...(Rachel starts to laugh, and Ross notices her.)Rachel: I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)Ross: All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)Chandler: Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)Joey: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.Phoebe: Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.Joey: What? Me having a job?Phoebe: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?Joey: Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.Phoebe: Really?(Phoebe turns and looks at Monica, while Joey frantically motions to Chandler to help him out.)Chandler: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.[cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]Gunther: ...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....Rachel: Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)Gunther: What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of empty trays on the back counter.)Rachel: Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.Gunther: They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot.’Rachel: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)Gunther: It’s all right. Sweetheart.[Scene: Sarah’s bedroom, her room is decorated with a space motif.]Ross: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.Sarah: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.Ross: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?Sarah: Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.Ross: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.Sarah: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.Ross: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?Sarah: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.Ross: Yeah.Sarah: So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.Ross: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?Sarah: Five dollars a box.Ross: (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?Sarah: A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dad couldn’t sell.Ross: Well, that makes sense.Sarah: Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?Ross: Yeah, Sarah, anything.Sarah: Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.[Scene: A hallway, Ross is selling Brown Bird cookies for Sarah, he stops and knocks on a door.]Woman: (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.) Yesss?Ross: Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.Woman: You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.Ross: No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)Woman: What does that mean?Ross: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.Woman: I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!Ross: No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.Woman: I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way.Ross: Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)Woman: I can still see you!Ross: All right!![Scene: Joey’s work, selling Christmas trees.]Phoebe: (walking up to Joey) Hey.Joey: Hey. What, what are you doing here?Phoebe: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...Joey: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....Phoebe: Destiny.Joey: Sure.Phoebe: Yes.Joey: All right.Phoebe: Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.Joey: Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.Phoebe: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.Joey: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.Phoebe: So, what happens to the old guys?Joey: Well, they go into the chipper.Phoebe: Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)Joey: (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands)[Scene: Central Perk, all except Phoebe are there, Ross is telling the gang, minus Rachel who’s still being retrained, about the different cookie options.]Ross: ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.Joey: All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.Ross: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?Chandler: Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?Ross: No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.(Chandler mouths ‘Okay.’)Ross: Mon?Monica: All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?Ross: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.Monica: No.Ross: Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.Monica: Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.Ross: I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.Monica: (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)Ross: Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)[cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]Gunther: And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.Rachel: (sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.Joey: Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?Rachel: Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.Chandler: How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?Rachel: Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.Joey: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.Rachel: The fear?Chandler: He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.Rachel: Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?(Chandler and Joey both laugh)Chandler: Because, I’m too afraid.Rachel: I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.Chandler: Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.Gunther: Rachel?Rachel: Yeah.Gunther: Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.Rachel: Can’t I just look at the handles on them?Gunther: You would think.Rachel: Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.Gunther: What?!Rachel: Gunther, I quit.Chandler: (to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is entering numbers on a calculator as Ross reads off how much he’s sold.]Ross: ....and 12, 22, 18, four...

When actually I’ll be in Cuba.Ross: All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.Chandler: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?Ross: Where in Cuba?[Scene: Joey’s sister’s house, Chandler hits himself on the head three times and knocks on the door three times.

(all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.Joey’s Sister: I say, punch him Joey.All: Yeah! Punch him!!Chandler: Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?Joey: Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!Chandler: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it.

Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?Chandler: Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.Phoebe: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!Chandler: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.Opening Credits[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are entering, Joey is on the phone.]Ross: She's having lunch with him.

Oh. (hugs her)[Scene: The Moondance Diner.]Monica: (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?Julio: What?Monica: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.Julio: Whoa, whoa, whoa.Monica: You don't even know me...Julio: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.Monica: What?Julio: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.Monica: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...Julio: No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?Monica: (sarcastically) Oh yeah.[Scene: Joey's audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.]Director: All right, let's do it!(The group does the same horrible dance that Joey did earlier in the show, except they're all out of sync and they do the jazz hands at the end.)Director: No, no, no. What was that?Joey: I know, it was the best I could get out of them.Director: Well, people!Joey: People, people, people.Director: Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.

Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.(Gunther is eavesdropping in the background.)Rachel: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?Ross: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.Gunther: Let it be me! Let it be me!Rachel: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)Ross: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.Chandler: Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?Rachel: Where ya going?Ross: Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.Rachel: Ohh, with who?Ross: Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.Rachel: There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!Ross: Yeah.Rachel: You have a play date with a stripper?!Chandler: Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)Ross: Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?Rachel: Sure, is she married?Ross: Ahh, no.Rachel: Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)Ross: Are you jealous?Rachel: Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?Ross: You are totally jealous.Rachel: I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...Ross: Honey, I love you too.Rachel: Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.Ross: What?(She runs over and gives him a very passionate kiss.)Ross: Huh.Rachel: (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.Chandler: Yeah.

(turns around) Hi!Richard: Hi!Monica: Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.Richard: So, you look great.Monica: Right.Richard: No you do. You... just...Monica: What?Richard: You’ve got panties stuck to your leg.Monica: (removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.Richard: It’s good to see you.Monica: It’s good to see you too.(They hug, and Richard notices a stocking stuck to Monica’s back, which he removes for her.)Opening Credits[Scene: continued from earlier.]Monica: You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.Richard: He’s gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy.

Since when do you roller blade?Phoebe: Oh! Since tomorrow.

How was your day?Joey: I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.Rachel: Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?Joey: Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.Rachel: But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?Joey: Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.Rachel: How often do you read it?Joey: Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?Rachel: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?Joey: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.Rachel: Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.Joey: All right, you got it.Rachel: All right.Joey: Okay.Rachel: Okay.Joey: Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.Rachel: Yeah.Joey: How little are they?

(Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) That’s my hand.Monica: Oops.Richard: Okay.Monica: Gotta keep squishing.Richard: Tomatoes are squishing.Monica: Okay.(Richard squishes a little too hard and some lands on his shirt.)Richard: Op.Monica: Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.Richard: Yeah.Monica: Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....(She is rubbing his chest and her voice trails off into silence, a long pause follows.)Richard: What?Monica: Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.Richard: I’ll just throw them out.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is watching Joey read Little Women, Ross is also there.]Joey: These little women.

You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday.Monica: Oh.Richard: You want me to cancel it?Monica: No!

Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.Monica: That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.Richard: Okay, okay, one thing’s changed.

I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’Joey: Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.Monica: Well, what did you do?Joey: What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.Monica: Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.Joey: All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....Monica: You gave her food poisoning!?Joey: I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.Phoebe: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!Joey: I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.(Phoebe and Monica both stand up and gasp.)Monica: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?Joey: I ran!![Scene: A street, Chandler is kissing Ginger.]Chandler: Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.Ginger: Actually, me too.Chandler: (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.Ginger: Oh damn, I hate that.Chandler: Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.Ginger: Oh, don’t worry about it.Chandler: No, really you’re gonna freeze.Ginger: No, I’m not.Chandler: You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?Ginger: Some day, maybe.[Scene: Ross’s bedroom, Rachel getting into bed while Ross is reading and laughs.]Rachel: Funny book?Ross: Hmmm.

I mean...Rachel: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?Ross: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?Rachel: I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.Ross: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.Rachel: Really!?Ross: Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.Rachel: Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?Ross: What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is looking at her beeper still in the pot.

Not that I even care, y'know.Monica: Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.Phoebe: You think you know me so well.Monica: Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?Phoebe: Yeah.Monica: Okay, well I do know you.Phoebe: That’s what I said.Monica: Well so?Phoebe: I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.[Scene: Central Perk, Leslie is singing.]Leslie: (singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends, pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky.

It’d be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.Phoebe: I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.Leslie: What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.Phoebe: Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.Leslie: Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.Phoebe: That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)[Scene: The lecture, Ross is passed out against Rachel’s shoulder.]Lecturer: ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.(Ross wakes up with a start and startles Rachel.

Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did.

I’m the smallest person in the world.Joey: (entering from his bedroom) Morning.Chandler: (to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.Joey: (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?Chandler: It came up.Joey: Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?(Both Chandler and Monica walk away in disgust.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are getting back from the lecture.]Ross: (entering) So I nodded off a little.Rachel: Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!Ross: Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.Rachel: Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’Ross: First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.Rachel: Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.Ross: Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.Rachel: Oh, that is so...Ross: No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)Rachel: Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?Ross: No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.Rachel: It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.Ross: That’s a little clearer.Rachel: Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?Ross: Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Ginger are eating dinner.]Ginger: Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?Chandler: No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?Ginger: It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?Chandler: No. No. I don’t think so.Ginger: Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.(They start making out. She opens his shirt and feels inside and stops.)Ginger: What’s that?Chandler: That’s-that’s my nubbin.Ginger: What’s a nubbin?Chandler: It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.Ginger: You have three nipples?Chandler: Well, y'know two regulars.

God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.Leslie: No, no, I don’t want to forget it.Phoebe: Okay y'know what you have to choose.

(runs over to Ross) Hi, Ross.Ross: Oh, hi Chloe.Chloe: I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’Chandler: And that’s the only colour that comes in.Issac: Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?Chloe: Oh! (storms off)Chandler: So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.Ross: Yeah, little change in plans.

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?Mischa: Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.Monica: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.Phoebe: (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.(Mischa does so.)Phoebe: You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.Mischa: (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.(Sergei responds.)Mischa: He says he was too.Phoebe: Interesting.Mischa: (to Monica) So I was wondering....Phoebe: Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.(Mischa does so, and Sergei complements Phoebe, and says it slowly)Mischa: (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a chef?Monica: I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.Mischa: Oh, really.Phoebe: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?Monica: Well, I was having a conversation.Phoebe: Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.Monica: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?Phoebe: That would be great. Thank you.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is lying in front of the bay window, and the phone rings.]Rachel: (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!Mark: Oh, hi.

What happened to him?Joey: Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]Rachel: Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.Mark: Wow. I’m sorry. Eggroll?Rachel: No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.Mark: Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.Rachel: Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)Rachel: Hello.Ross: Hi!

Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)Chloe: Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.Ross: Ah, that’s okay, thanks.Chloe: Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.Ross: Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?Chloe: Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him)[Scene: The Restaurant, after dinner.]Mischa: (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.Monica: Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?Phoebe: Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.(Sergei says something to Mischa.)Mischa: (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.Phoebe: Well, tell him, apology accepted.(Mischa does so.)Mischa: (to Monica) Oh, he’s unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English, Sergei?Phoebe: Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?Monica: Hey, the man’s dog just died.(Sergei insults Mischa, and they get into a huge fight, in Russian.)Mischa: (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.Monica: It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons.

I so want to be a Waxine girl.Monica: I know!!Phoebe: God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?Monica: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!Phoebe: They have the best stuff in there.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.]Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!Joey: Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?Ross: You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.Chandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?Ross: What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?Joey: Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.Chandler: He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.Joey: Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.Ross: Yeah, but don’t you think....Chandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.Ross: Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)Joey: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?Ross: What trail?Joey: (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!Ross: Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.Chandler: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it![Scene: Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.]Phoebe: (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,Monica: Did that!Phoebe: Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.Monica: Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!Phoebe: Was it not pain-free?Monica: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.Phoebe: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.Monica: That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.Phoebe: (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!Monica: Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?[Scene: The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]Ross: (entering) Chloe? Hi..Chloe: Is this about me taking your watch?Ross: You took my watch?Chloe: I’m sorry, I do that.Ross: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?Chloe: Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.Ross: Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?Chloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.Ross: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...Issac: You dog!Ross: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.Issac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.Ross: Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.Issac: Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.Ross: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?Issac: Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.Ross: Actually, no, we’re not.Issac: Yeah, we are.Ross: No, we’re not.Issac: Yeah, we are.Ross: No, we’re not!!Issac: Okay, we’re not.Ross: Right.Issac: But, we are.Ross: Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.Issac: I can promise not to tell her again.[Scene: Phoebe’s Work, Ross is now trying to stop Jasmine from telling Phoebe.]Ross: (entering out of breath) Jasmine?Jasmine: Uh-huh.Ross: We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.Jasmine: You did a bad thing!Ross: Yes, I did.Jasmine: Very bad!Ross: Very bad.Jasmine: Very, very bad.Ross: I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?Jasmine: No.Ross: Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?Jasmine: All right.Ross: Thank you, thank you.Jasmine: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.Ross: (angrily) Who’s your roommate?[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is wiping down the counter as Ross rushes in.]Ross: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.Gunther: I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?(Ross turns around and sees Rachel sitting by the window. She is just glaring at him.)Commercial Break[Scene: Monica’s Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are removing the rest of their wax strips.]Monica: Ow!Phoebe: Oh!!Monica: Ow!! Ow!!Phoebe: Ow!!!Monica and Phoebe: Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!(Hearing the screaming Chandler and Joey rush in. Joey has a pan, Chandler has a tea kettle.)Phoebe: We’re all right.Monica: It’s okay, it’s okay.Phoebe: We’re all right.Monica: We were just waxing our legs.Chandler: Off?!!Phoebe: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.Chandler: Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.Joey: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.Phoebe: Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)Chandler: Oh, that’s mature.Joey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?Phoebe: Uh-huh.Monica: That’s right.(Joey laughs, pulls it off, then does a high-pitched whine.)[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is trying to close the door on Ross.]Ross: (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!![Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler slowly closes the door, and we hear Rachel from the living room.]Rachel: I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!Monica: What?Chandler: Nothing, nothing.Monica: (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.Phoebe: (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?Ross: Rachel?[Cut to Living Room]Rachel: Just get away from me!Ross: No, it was a mistake!

Her purse?![Cut to Monica's bedroom]Phoebe: Whe-where did he put it?![Cut to Living Room]Rachel: Ross, you had sex with another woman![Cut to Monica's bedroom, both Monica and Phoebe gasp.]Monica: Oh my God.Phoebe: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....Monica: Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!Chandler: (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.[Cut to Living Room]Rachel: (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!Ross: No!!Rachel: Just get out! Now!!Ross: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?[Cut to Monica's bedroom]Chandler: Uh-oh.[Cut to Living Room]Ross: What?Rachel: Was she good?[Cut to Monica's bedroom]Joey: Don’t answer that.[Cut to Living Room]Rachel: Come on Ross!

Okay, okay, okay, okay.[Cut to Monica's bedroom]Phoebe: Should we do something?Chandler: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.[Cut to Living Room]Ross: I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.Rachel: Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!(Ross hands Rachel back the newspaper, and she starts beating him with it again.)Ross: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!Rachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!(She throws the paper at him, misses and hits Monica’s door, they all jump back at the sound.)Ross: Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.Rachel: We were on a break!Ross: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.Rachel: You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?Ross: Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!Rachel: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake![Cut to Monica's bedroom]Joey: Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)Monica: (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.Joey: Why not?!

Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!Rachel: Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.[Cut to Monica's bedroom]Chandler: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.Joey: Yeah, we’ll be fine.[Cut to Living Room]Ross: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.[Cut to Monica's bedroom]Chandler: (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.[Later, Phoebe is on the phone, they’re all still trapped in Monica’s bedroom.]Phoebe: Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.[Cut to Living Room]Ross: Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?Rachel: All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?Ross: (pause) Yes I would.Rachel: You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?Ross: (less sure) Yes.Rachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....Ross: (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.[Cut to Monica's bedroom]All: Ohhhhh![Later, Ross and Rachel are sitting in the kitchen.]Ross: What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?Rachel: I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.Ross: Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’(She turns around and glares at him, he turns away.)[Cut to Monica's bedroom]Joey: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.Phoebe: We could eat the wax! It’s organic.Chandler: Oh great, food with hair on it.Phoebe: No, not the used wax.Chandler: Because that would be crazy?[Cut to Living Room]Ross: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.Rachel: Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.Ross: No anchovies.Rachel: With ah, extra anchovies.Ross: That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.Rachel: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?[Cut to later, they are finishing up the pizza, there’s one piece left.]Ross: You can have the last piece, if you want.Rachel: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.[Cut to Monica's bedroom, they’re all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe, don’t like it. Joey tries some and makes a face like: ‘Hey, that’s not so bad.’]Phoebe: They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?Chandler: Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.Monica: What if they don’t?(Long pause.)Joey: You think I need a new walk?Chandler: What?Joey: Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.Chandler: Are you actually saying these words?[Later, in the living room, Rachel is sitting on the couch, Ross is on the chair.]Ross: What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey![Cut to Monica's bedroom]Joey: Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) Yeah, okay.Monica: Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.Phoebe: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.[Cut to Living Room]Ross: Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!Rachel: That’s....Ross: That’s what?!Rachel: That is neither here nor there.Ross: Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.(He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just before he kisses her on the lips....)Rachel: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?Ross: Okay, okay, okay.Rachel: (softly) I think you should go.Ross: What?Rachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.Ross: (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...Rachel: Yeah, what the hell did I know!Ross: Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....Rachel: (crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.[We see the rest of them are now crying.]Ross: (crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.(Pause)Rachel: Then how come it is?Closing Credits[Scene: Monica’s bedroom.]Phoebe: They’ve been quiet for a long time.Joey: Maybe she killed him?Chandler: Let’s go.[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is sleeping on the couch, Ross is gone, the rest of them can finally emerge from their cell. They all wave good bye, and start to walk quietly out, as Monica goes and puts a blanket on Rachel. Joey starts walking all hunched over and bobbing his shoulders as he goes.]Chandler: (to Joey) Is that your new walk?Joey: (whispering) No, I really have to pee.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch reading.]Joey: Can I see the comics?Chandler: This is the New York Times.Joey: Okay, may I see the comics?[Monica and Phoebe enter.]Monica: Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?Chandler: We are. He’s meeting us here.Monica: No! Rachel is meeting us here.Phoebe: Oh come on, they can be in the same room.Joey: Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.Phoebe: Why? What happened now?Joey: Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....Chandler: Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.Joey: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.Phoebe: Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.Joey: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.Phoebe: Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.Chandler: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.Phoebe: Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....Joey: I had the same dream!Phoebe: Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.Joey: Oh, I had the opposite dream.Chandler: Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.Joey: Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.Monica: It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.[Rachel enters.]Monica: (seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!Rachel: Hey!Monica: Let’s get the show on it!Rachel: Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.Monica: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.Rachel: Closer than here?Phoebe: (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.Rachel: Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.Phoebe: Okay, your highness.[Ross enters behind Rachel, and look at each other for a moment.]Phoebe: (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!Opening Credits[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the whole gang is there, except for Ross and Rachel. Joey is trying to eat Chinese with chopsticks and fails miserably. There’s a knock on the door, and Chandler answers it to reveal Rachel]Rachel: (softly) Is he here?Chandler: No.Rachel: Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!Monica and Phoebe: Hey!Rachel: You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?Chandler: Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.Rachel: Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.Phoebe: No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.Rachel: Hm-mm.Chandler: Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.Rachel: Ohh!Monica: We’re sorry honey.Rachel: Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)Joey: Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?Rachel: And heels.Joey: (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.Rachel: No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)[Chandler makes a noise of absolute disgust and heads into the living room.]Phoebe: Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.Joey: Oh yeah.Monica: Very bad.[We see Chandler lighting up a cigarette.]Phoebe: Chandler what are you doing?!Monica: Chandler!!Chandler: (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!Joey: You’re smoking again?!Chandler: Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.Phoebe: Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?Chandler: Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.Monica: Weren’t you nine?!Chandler: Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....[There’s a knock on the door.]Chandler: Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.Phoebe: Him? Him, Ross?Chandler: Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)Rachel: Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.All: Absolutely, yeah!Rachel: Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!Chandler: Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!![Scene: Ross’s, the gang, minus Rachel of course, is there. Chandler is forced to smoke by an open window.]Joey: (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!Phoebe: Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.Ross: Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.Chandler: Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.Ross: Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!Joey: It’ll be great for next weekend.Ross: No, no, no, this weekend guys!Joey: It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it’ll be grrreat.Ross: What’s going on?Phoebe: Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)Ross: So, for the whole weekend?Monica: We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.Ross: Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.Phoebe: Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.Joey: Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.Monica: Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.Ross: What a pity stay?Monica: No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!Ross: Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.Chandler: Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.[Scene: In Phoebe’s Grandmother’s cab, driving up to the cabin. Phoebe’s driving, Rachel’s sitting shotgun, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are in the back seat.]Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?Monica: Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?Chandler: (to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.Joey: What? Mine aren’t tinted.[Chandler starts to light a cigarette.]Phoebe: Chandler!!Chandler: What?Phoebe: What does the sign say?Chandler: Beam me up Jesus.Phoebe: No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.Chandler: Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.All: Oh!Phoebe: Please!Monica: No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.Chandler: Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.Joey: Oh, now I have to go!![Scene: The rest stop, Phoebe’s pulling in.]Chandler: Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.Monica: What?[Both Chandler and Joey put their feet up against the glass, Monica doesn’t and gets thrown up against the glass.]Rachel: Okay.Monica: Ow![Joey gets out and sprints to the bathroom and Chandler follows with a cigarette in his hands.]Phoebe: (to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?Rachel: No. Thank you.Monica: (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.Rachel: Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)Phoebe: No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!Joey: What’s going on?Chandler: (to Joey) My lighter’s in there!

Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.Monica: So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?Joey: Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!Monica: What?!Rachel: What?!Joey: Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?Monica: Please!!Joey: Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.The Girls: No, not getting my bra!Joey: If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.Phoebe: Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.Monica: These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.Rachel: What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.Monica: All right then, your bra would still be big.Rachel: No, I stuff outside the bra.Chandler: Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.Phoebe: All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.[Chandler crumples up his cigarette pack and throws it on the ground.]Rachel: (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.Chandler: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.Phoebe: (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.Joey: Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.Chandler: Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.Joey: (opening the door) And there you go!All: Oh, yeahhhhh!!![They all run to get in the cab, and Chandler pulls out a smoke.]Monica: Chandler!!Chandler: At least let me smoke it to the good part.[Phoebe puts the car in gear and starts to back out.]Phoebe: Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!Rachel: What, what’s it, what’s going on?Phoebe: Yeah, this has happened before.Rachel: So you know how to fix it?Phoebe: Yep. Put more gas in.[Scene: Carol and Susan’s, Carol is setting a romantic dinner for Susan as there is a knock on the door.]Carol: (answering the door) Hi!Ross: (entering) Hey.Carol: Hey, what are you doing here?Ross: Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?Carol: Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.Ross: Where’s Ben?Carol: He’s sleeping.Ross: Ahh.

I thought you guys got married in uh, January?Carol: It’s not that kind of anniversary.Ross: Ah! (realises) Oh.Carol: Sooo!! Anyway...Ross: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.Carol: Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.Ross: Yeah, well.Carol: Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?Ross: Oh yeah, I’d love that.Carol: Oh, great! Me too.Ross: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)[Scene: The rest stop, Phoebe is on the phone to the motor club.]Phoebe: Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.Rachel: Great!Phoebe: Yeah, what town are we near?Monica: Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?Phoebe: (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?Rachel: Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.Phoebe: Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?Rachel: I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.Phoebe: Okay.

(hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do that.Rachel: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.Monica: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.Rachel: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!Phoebe: But if...Rachel: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.Phoebe: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.[Joey walks up helping Chandler.]Monica: So the going for help went well?Joey: Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.Chandler: I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)Monica: Then why are you smoking?Chandler: Well it’s very unsettling.[Scene: Carol and Susan’s, Ross is eating the dinner Carol made for Susan.]Ross: ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.Carol: Ah, Susan will be so pleased.[Ross’s beeper goes off.]Ross: (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?Carol: No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.[Cut to the rest stop, Monica and Phoebe are waiting anxiously by the phone as it rings.]Phoebe: (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.Ross: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?Phoebe: I ate a bug.[Rachel starts to walk up.]Monica: (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)Phoebe: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.Ross: Oh, now you want a favour?Phoebe: Yes, please.Ross: Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?Carol: (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe, hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.Ross: No, I’m not gonna pick them up.Carol: Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.Ross: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....Carol: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.Ross: Yeah, you’re right.Carol: (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something.

What’s doofus spelled backwards?[Ross drives up.]Rachel: (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!Phoebe: Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!Chandler and Joey: Hey!!Phoebe: Hi!Rachel: What is he doing here?!Ross: He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.All: No! Come on!Rachel: All right!! Fine! Fine.[Ross grabs the gas can he brought along, and walks through Joey’s sign destroying it.]Joey: Arrrghh!!Chandler: Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!Phoebe: (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?Chandler: Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.Joey: Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?Monica: I know, what about Rachel?

And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.Rachel: (to Monica) What?!Monica: (shyly) I don’t know.Ross: That’s what you said last night.Monica: What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!Ross: Okay.Rachel: Really Joey?Joey: (pause) What?Phoebe: Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.Rachel: No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.Ross: Obviously not to Joey.[They all turn around and look at Joey.]Joey: (pause) What?[They all start fighting with each other.]Ross: (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.Chandler: Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)[They stop briefly to look at Chandler, but then start fighting again.]Phoebe: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.Joey: Yeah, and not put us in the middle.Phoebe: Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?Rachel: Yeah.Ross: I can.Phoebe: Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.Joey: Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?Ross: Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.Joey: Come on man, you drove all the way up here.Ross: No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.Rachel: Thank you.Monica: All right, we’ll call you when we get back.Ross: Okay.Phoebe: Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.Ross: Okay.Phoebe: Or, or the rodeo!!Ross: That would be great.Phoebe: Okay!Chandler: I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.Ross: I know![They all get in the cab and drive away.]Phoebe: Bye!!![Ross tries to start the truck, and discovers the battery’s dead.]Closing Credits[Scene: Carol and Susan’s, Carol is running to answer the door.]Carol: (looking through the peephole) Ugh.

At least let me finish this last one.Gunther: Okay, but only if you give me a drag.Chandler: Okay.(Chandler hands him the cigarette, and he takes a long drag.)Gunther: Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler back the cigarette.)Chandler: No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.(He goes and sits down next to Rachel and puts a cigarette in his mouth, which Rachel takes away from him. He puts another cigarette in his mouth, and Rachel takes it away again.)Chandler: Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.Rachel: Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)Chandler: Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)Rachel: Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.Ross: Pffhah.Rachel: (to Ross) What’s your problem?Ross: Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.Rachel: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.Ross: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.Rachel: Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.Phoebe: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.Chandler: Or what my Father called Thursday night.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier, Ross is handing Rachel a cup of coffee.]Ross: Here you go.Rachel: Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.Ross: Sorry.

Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.(Both Chandler and Phoebe have shocked looks on their faces.)Rachel: Oh my God!! Great!Phoebe: Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?Frank: I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right?Alice: Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us.Phoebe: Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.Alice: Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?(They both growl and hiss at each other and then kiss passionately again.)[Scene: Chandler’s bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.]Hypnosis Tape: You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Monica is working, Rachel is having lunch.]Monica: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.Rachel: Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.Monica: (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?Pete: Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.Monica: Haven’t you and I covered that topic?Pete: Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….Monica: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.Pete: Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?Rachel: (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.Monica: I mean really, think about it.Pete: Ho-ho, I will.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are being lectured by Phoebe.]Phoebe: No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!Ross: Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?Phoebe: No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!Joey: Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.Phoebe: But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.Joey: Well, have-have you told him how you feel?Phoebe: Yes. Not out loud.Ross: Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.Phoebe: Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.Ross and Joey: No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)Phoebe: Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!Ross and Joey: No.Phoebe: Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)Joey: So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Monica are entering.]Rachel: I think you should definitely go out with this guy.Monica: Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.Rachel: Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?Monica: Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) All right, I get your point.Rachel: All right.Chandler: (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.Monica: Hey.Chandler: Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?Monica: Uh, yeah.Rachel: Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?Chandler: Y'know what, pretty good.Rachel: Yeah?Chandler: Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.Rachel: Thank you.Monica: Here you go.Chandler: ThanksRachel: Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.Chandler: What check thing?Monica: As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.Chandler: (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?Monica: That’s Bill Clinton.Chandler: Who’s he huggin’?Monica: Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?Chandler: This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!Rachel: We use it!!Chandler: There you go!!Rachel: Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.Monica: I’m not gonna go out with him.Rachel: Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.Monica: Or incredibly offensive.Rachel: Oh yeah, sure, that too.(Chandler is putting on the Chap Stick the same way that women put on lipstick, including the bit with the piece of tissue.)Chandler: (to the girls who are staring at him) What?[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are talking to Frank.]Ross: All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.Joey: Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.Frank: What, you don’t think I know that?Joey: Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet!Ross: Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.Frank: Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about.Joey: Yeah, in a poem maybe.Ross: No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.Frank: You don’t have it anymore?Ross: No, I ah, I slept with someone else.Frank: Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?Ross: It didn’t.Frank: Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice.Joey: Now, wh-what, what is that like?Frank: It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.Ross: Yeah, yeah.Joey: (to Ross) Why can’t I find that?Ross: Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!Joey: Well, I want it!Frank: You can have it!Joey: I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.Ross: Oh, no! No!Frank: It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it!!Joey: Then you hold on to it!!Frank: All right, man!!Joey: All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it’s after Ross and Joey’s talk with Frank, and Phoebe’s is finding out what happened.]Phoebe: (to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!Joey: I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.Phoebe: Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!Ross: I’m the ring bearer.(As Phoebe stands there in shock and disbelief, Chandler comes out of the bathroom and walks to his bedroom. He’s just got out of the shower and has the towel wrapped around himself high across his chest, and another towel wrapped around his head, like women wear towels. Joey watches Chandler wondering what the hell he’s doing.)Commercial Break[Scene: Phoebe’s, Phoebe is opening the door.]Phoebe: Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)Alice: Oh my God, who died on this?!Phoebe: Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?Alice: Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…Phoebe: Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.Alice: Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.Phoebe: Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.[Scene: Pete’s office, he is participating in a conference call with three other employees, each of whom are on a different TV screen that he controls with a remote.]Pete: Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.All: Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.(The intercom buzzes.)Secretary: You have a Miss Monica Geller here.Pete: Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.Monica: What the hell is this? (holding up the check)Pete: Hang on a second. (to the employees) I’ll-I’ll talk to you in the morning. (turns two of the three off) I’m sorry what?Monica: Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?Pete: Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.Monica: You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?Employee: Umm, I’m still here.Pete: (turns off the TV) You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.Monica: What?!Pete: Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.Monica: Okay, umm, you’re a loon.Pete: Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say?Monica: I don’t know.Pete: Why not?Monica: ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.Pete: One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.[Scene: Phoebe’s, she is coming home. She turns on the lights, and sits down on the couch.]Frank: (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!Phoebe: Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?Frank: Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?Phoebe: Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?Frank: Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.Phoebe: What umm, what happened?Frank: Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.Phoebe: Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?Frank: Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?Frank: Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!Phoebe: Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)Frank: Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!Phoebe: Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?Frank: What?Phoebe: Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.Frank: Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?Phoebe: Okay.Frank: Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.Phoebe: Okay, but.Frank: Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go…[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Monica ready for her date. The guys are also there. The door buzzes.]Rachel: Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!Chandler: (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)Monica: Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?Chandler: Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.Monica: I know!!Chandler: Okay, then get the lobster!Monica: (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!Pete: Hi.Rachel: Hi!!Joey: Hey!Ross: Hi!(They’re all staring at him, with big, huge smiles on their faces.)Joey: Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?Monica: And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.All: Oh-no-no-no-no….Rachel: Just one drink?!Monica: (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?Pete: Hey, you like pizza?Monica: Oh, that’s sounds great.Pete: I know a great little place.[Cut to a shot of the coliseum in Rome, Italy.][Scene: A restaurant in Rome, Monica is paying for the pizza.]Pete: You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!Monica: Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?Pete: Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that.Monica: Why, how much is that?Pete: That’s about 60 cents.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it’s the middle of the night. Joey is walking into the living room, and runs into the entertainment centre.]Joey: Every night!!(He starts to walk to the bathroom and hears the hypnosis tape from Chandler’s bedroom.)Hypnosis Tape: You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)[Scene: Phoebe’s, Frank is watching TV, and he’s very depressed as Phoebe enters.]Phoebe: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.Alice: Hi Frank.Frank: Hi, Mrs. Knight.Alice: Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that what it is?Phoebe: Yeah, but not just that.Alice: Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less…Phoebe: None the less.Alice: None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)Phoebe: That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).Closing Credits[Scene: Chandler’s bedroom, he’s listening to the hypnosis tape again.]Hypnosis Tape: Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.Joey: (He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.(Chandler wakes up and stares at the tape.)[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.]Gunther: Here you go.Rachel: Thank you.Gunther: (In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you’d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.Mark: (entering) Hi!Rachel: Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!Mark: Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say.Rachel: Oh, okay.Mark: I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But since you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now.(Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)Rachel: Wow! Umm....(She’s interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)Gunther: I dropped a cup.Opening Credits[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from their date.]Pete: ...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.Monica: Oh, this is so great.Pete: Yeah, it was.Monica: All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.(She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)Monica: Hello, people who do not live here.All: Hi! Hello!Monica: I gave you a key for emergencies!Phoebe: We were out of Doritos.Ross: Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?Chandler: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.Monica: He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!Ross: Still?!Monica: Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.Chandler: Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?Monica: Two.Chandler: Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?Joey: (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)Ross: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.Monica and Phoebe: Oh.Chandler: Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.[Scene: A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play he’s in.]The Director: Joe. How’s it going?Joey: Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.Kate: Hi.Joey: Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?Kate: Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?Joey: Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.Kate: Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.(She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of coffee.)Joey: So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?Kate: Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.Joey: Oh, forget about it. She rocks!Kate: Where do I know you from?Joey: Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.Kate: No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?Joey: Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.Kate: That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!!Joey: See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.Kate: Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.Joey: Yeah, that was real.[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind them.]Phoebe: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.Rachel: I know.Phoebe: What, so what are you gonna tell him?Rachel: Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.Phoebe: Huh.(Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)Rachel: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.Phoebe: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.Rachel: I don’t have any issues with my Father.Phoebe: Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]Joey: I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.Ross: (entering) Hello.Chandler and Joey: Hey!Ross: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.Joey: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?Ross: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.Chandler: It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.Ross: Then be supportive like a guy.Chandler: (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.]Ross: Hi.Rachel: Hi!Ross: You ah, wanted to see me?Rachel: Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)Ross: What?!Rachel: Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.Ross: What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?Rachel: No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?Ross: Yes.Rachel: Yeah?Ross: Yes, I do.Rachel: Good.Ross: Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!Rachel: Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.Ross: It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!Rachel: Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.Ross: No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.Rachel: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!Ross: I’m just trying to help you, move on.Rachel: Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....Ross: Petty...Rachel: Petty... (goes into her room)Ross: Petty...Rachel: Petty...Ross: Petty...Rachel: Small...Ross: Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)Rachel: You are so just doing this out of spite.Ross: Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!Rachel: Huh?Ross: I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)Rachel: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!Ross: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!Ross: Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)[Scene: Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]Phoebe: So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)Chandler: And you’re our age. You’re our age.Phoebe: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.Pete: What like Pete Dakota?Phoebe: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.Joey: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.Chandler: That’s not a state Joe.Joey: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?Pete: I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.All: Okay.Chandler: You’re our age!Pete: (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?Monica: Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!Phoebe: Yeah, kinda.[Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]Kate: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?Joey: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.The Director: Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.Kate: I have a question about this scene.The Director: Yes?Kate: Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.The Director: Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.Joey: Yeah.Kate: I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.Joey: Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.Kate: It doesn’t say that in the script.Joey: It does in mine![Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]Chandler: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?Ross: You bug me.[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]Chandler: Is there any chance you didn’t see that?Commercial Break[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring out the peephole.]Chandler: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!Ross: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!Chandler: You didn’t just break up.Ross: Hey, it’s been like three weeks!Chandler: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!Ross: Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.Chandler: Okay.Ross: She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!Chandler: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.Ross: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!Chandler: Stop what?!Ross: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing hold of the foosball table.)Chandler: No!! You can’t!!Ross: Look, they must be stopped!Chandler: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!Ross: I need juice!

(Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)Ross: Juice, I need...Chandler: She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.Ross: Yeah, okay.Chandler: Okay.Ross: It’s just I miss her so much.Chandler: I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.]Mark: Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?Rachel: Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’(She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesn’t react. He tries it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)Rachel: Y'know what?Mark: No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to.Rachel: I can’t do this.Mark: Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.Rachel: Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.Mark: Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!Rachel: Oh God.

Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?Pete: Oh, yeah. I know that.Monica: I so wanna be attracted to you.Pete: But you’re not. Okay, good.Monica: I’m sorry.Pete: Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘cause it’s not so bad.Monica: It’s not?Pete: I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.Monica: Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.Pete: Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you wanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start to leave)Spokeswoman: And the man who made all this possible...

(Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?Joey: Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!Chandler: Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.Joey: God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’Chandler: I think somebody has a crush on somebody.Joey: Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?Chandler: I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.Joey: Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.Chandler: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!Joey: Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?![Scene: The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.]Kate: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?Joey: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.The Director: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.Kate: Well, that was ah...Joey: Better?Kate: Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement.

Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.Monica: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.Rachel: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)Monica: Something wrong?Rachel: (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)Closing Credits[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the black chairs.]Chandler: So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?Phoebe: Okay well, he would turn things to gold.Chandler: What about things that are already gold?Phoebe: Ahh, his work is done.Chandler: Okay, let’s play my game now.[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.]Gunther: Here you go.Rachel: Thank you.Gunther: (In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime.

All right, let’s go shoppin’!!Mark: Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say.Rachel: Oh, okay.Mark: I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But since you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now.(Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)Rachel: Wow! Umm....(She’s interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)Gunther: I dropped a cup.Opening Credits[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from their date.]Pete: ...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.Monica: Oh, this is so great.Pete: Yeah, it was.Monica: All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.(She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)Monica: Hello, people who do not live here.All: Hi! Hello!Monica: I gave you a key for emergencies!Phoebe: We were out of Doritos.Ross: Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?Chandler: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.Monica: He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!Ross: Still?!Monica: Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.Chandler: Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?Monica: Two.Chandler: Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?Joey: (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)Ross: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.Monica and Phoebe: Oh.Chandler: Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.[Scene: A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play he’s in.]The Director: Joe. How’s it going?Joey: Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.Kate: Hi.Joey: Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?Kate: Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?Joey: Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.Kate: Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.(She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of coffee.)Joey: So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?Kate: Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.Joey: Oh, forget about it. She rocks!Kate: Where do I know you from?Joey: Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.Kate: No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?Joey: Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.Kate: That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!!Joey: See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.Kate: Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.Joey: Yeah, that was real.[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind them.]Phoebe: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.Rachel: I know.Phoebe: What, so what are you gonna tell him?Rachel: Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.Phoebe: Huh.(Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)Rachel: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.Phoebe: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.Rachel: I don’t have any issues with my Father.Phoebe: Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]Joey: I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.Ross: (entering) Hello.Chandler and Joey: Hey!Ross: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.Joey: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?Ross: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.Chandler: It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.Ross: Then be supportive like a guy.Chandler: (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.]Ross: Hi.Rachel: Hi!Ross: You ah, wanted to see me?Rachel: Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)Ross: What?!Rachel: Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.Ross: What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?Rachel: No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?Ross: Yes.Rachel: Yeah?Ross: Yes, I do.Rachel: Good.Ross: Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!Rachel: Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.Ross: It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!Rachel: Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.Ross: No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.Rachel: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!Ross: I’m just trying to help you, move on.Rachel: Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....Ross: Petty...Rachel: Petty... (goes into her room)Ross: Petty...Rachel: Petty...Ross: Petty...Rachel: Small...Ross: Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)Rachel: You are so just doing this out of spite.Ross: Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!Rachel: Huh?Ross: I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)Rachel: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!Ross: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!Ross: Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)[Scene: Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]Phoebe: So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)Chandler: And you’re our age. You’re our age.Phoebe: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.Pete: What like Pete Dakota?Phoebe: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.Joey: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.Chandler: That’s not a state Joe.Joey: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?Pete: I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.All: Okay.Chandler: You’re our age!Pete: (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?Monica: Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!Phoebe: Yeah, kinda.[Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]Kate: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?Joey: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.The Director: Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.Kate: I have a question about this scene.The Director: Yes?Kate: Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.The Director: Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.Joey: Yeah.Kate: I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.Joey: Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.Kate: It doesn’t say that in the script.Joey: It does in mine![Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]Chandler: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?Ross: You bug me.[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]Chandler: Is there any chance you didn’t see that?Commercial Break[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring out the peephole.]Chandler: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!Ross: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!Chandler: You didn’t just break up.Ross: Hey, it’s been like three weeks!Chandler: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!Ross: Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.Chandler: Okay.Ross: She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!Chandler: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.Ross: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!Chandler: Stop what?!Ross: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing hold of the foosball table.)Chandler: No!! You can’t!!Ross: Look, they must be stopped!Chandler: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!Ross: I need juice! People need juice!!Chandler: Look man!Ross: People need juice!Chandler: Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)Ross: Juice, I need...Chandler: She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.Ross: Yeah, okay.Chandler: Okay.Ross: It’s just I miss her so much.Chandler: I know.

But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.Ross: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.Phoebe: Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.Rachel: (entering) Hey!All: Hello.Rachel: I need to talk to you!Ross: Sure, what’s up?Rachel: Oh, sorry.

Please? What do you say?[A phone rings.]The Director: (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, just one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! (He goes to take the call.)Joey: (to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?Kate: He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating.Joey: Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?Kate: I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?Joey: Do you want me to want you to care?Kate: Do you?Joey: What?The Director: (returning) Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off.[They resume rehearsing.]Joey: Come on baby, don’t go.

Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?Joey: Maybe he could slip her the tongue.Kate: Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.Joey: Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.Kate: And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!Joey: And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!Kate: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....[cut to Joey’s bedroom, Joey and Kate are emerging from under the covers.]Joey: Something like that?Kate: Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind.Joey: Yeah.Commercial Break[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are eating breakfast as Joey enters, very happily.]Joey: (to Ross) Hey.Ross: Hi.Joey: (to Monica) Hey.(He walks up behind Monica and gives her a big hug and a kiss on the neck.)Ross: Hi.Joey: Hey.(He walks over behind Ross, thinks about it for a moment, and gives him a big hug.)Ross: It’s a little early to be drinkin’.Joey: No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.Ross: Ohhhhh!Monica: You’re kidding?! That’s great!Joey: Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...Monica: Oh my.Joey: Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been processed by the devil, or something.)Chandler: (entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’Rachel: Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?Chandler: That’s what you say at the end of a date.Rachel: You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’Chandler: To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.Monica: Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?Rachel: Well, they always called.Monica: Hmm, bite me.[Scene: Rachel’s office.]Joanna: (entering) Did he call?Rachel: No. Sorry.Joanna: Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?Sophie: Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.Joanna: Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?Rachel: Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.Joanna: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?Rachel: Well...Joanna: The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?Rachel: No. I...Joanna: Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is reading a magazine as Rachel approaches.]Rachel: (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!Chandler: Multiple, so many paper cuts.Rachel: Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.Rachel: Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!Chandler: Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’Rachel: Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.Chandler: Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!Rachel: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!Chandler: All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!Rachel: That’s fine!Chandler: That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.Rachel: I know.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]Ross: Mon?Monica: (from the bathroom) I’m in the shower![He closes the door and walks over to get something from the fridge. He starts to smell something and turns around to see Phoebe’s dollhouse smoking. He runs over and takes off the roof to reveal that the dollhouse fire.]Ross: Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!![He tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesn’t work. He runs over to the sink to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. In desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesn’t work. He then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. He kicks open the door and we hear Monica scream at the top of her lungs.][Scene: The Theatre, Kate is arriving for rehearsal.]Joey: Hey.Kate: Hi.Joey: So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?Kate: About what?Joey: Y'know, about what happened with us.Kate: Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay?Joey: What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.Kate: Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?Joey: Nooo.Lauren: (entering) Hi, Kate!Kate: Hi, Lauren.Joey: Hi, Lauren.Lauren: Hi, pig![Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are inspecting the damage to the dollhouse.]Ross: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.Monica: Oh, that’s okay.

(sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!Ross: Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.Phoebe: All right. Did everyone get out okay?Monica: Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.Phoebe: Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)Ross: No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!Phoebe: (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!(She picks up a charred piece of plastic that once was the Foster puppets, and starts to break down. Monica goes over and comforts her.)[Scene: Rachel’s office, Chandler and Joanna are returning from their lunch date. He is telling her about her mascara problem. Rachel is already there.]Chandler: It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.Joanna: Well, thanks again for lunch.Chandler: (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.(Rachel is slowing trying to leave and let them talk.)Joanna: It was, wasn’t it?Chandler: The food there was, was great.Joanna: Wasn’t it?Chandler: So take care.Joanna: You too.Chandler: Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)Joanna: Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?Rachel: Sophie’s desk.(Chandler starts to leave ashamed of himself, but Rachel stops him in the hallway.)Rachel: (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!Chandler: Noo!Rachel: Chandler!!Chandler: Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.Rachel: Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)Chandler: Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.Joanna: What?Chandler: I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.Joanna: Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.Chandler: Yeah, o-okay.Joanna: So...Chandler: Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!(Rachel is shocked, and holds her arms out in disbelief.)Closing Credits[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is talking on the phone.]Joey: (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye.

Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)Gunther: (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa.[He distracts her from catching Monica and Monica slams into her, knocking her down. Monica then falls on top of her.]Phoebe: Oh my God, are you guys okay?Gunther: Are you all right?Joey: (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is moaning in pain.)

Like for clubbing.Monica: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.Rachel: Oh my God. (starting to cry)Monica: I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)Phoebe: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?Rachel: You didn’t break up with that fireman?Phoebe: No, that was my way of telling you.

What?!Guru Saj: We appear to have angered it.Ross: We?! We angered it?!Guru Saj: Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonna have to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a ‘What?’ look) Love.Ross: Oh God!Guru Saj: (He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to…Ross: Ow!!Guru Saj: Oops.Ross: What was, what was that?Guru Saj: Well it’s gone.Ross: What?!

Is there any—Oh, there’s the cream.Billy: Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.Robin: What is it, Tim?Billy: It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife.Joey: (to Billy) So you’re the gynaecologist?Billy: (to Joey) Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!Robin: (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy) And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!Billy: Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)[cut to the gang, they’re all stunned]Phoebe: So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?Monica: (pause) I have no idea.Opening Credits[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]Rachel: So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?Phoebe: No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.Monica: He didn’t ask me to marry him.All: Ohh.Phoebe: Well then definately don’t take his name.Monica: He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.The Guys: Pete?!Rachel: Why?! What is it?Monica: I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.Phoebe: (intrigued) Oh?!Monica: Yeah, but without the costumes.Phoebe: (disappointed) Oh.Joey: And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.Chandler: Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”Monica: So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?Ross: Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.Monica: What’s fish hooking?Ross: Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?Joey: What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.[Scene: Chandler’s office, he is just finishing a meeting with his boss.]Doug: So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team.Chandler: Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.Doug: (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What’s your name?Chandler: Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...Doug: No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to leave) This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is making reservations.]Ross: (on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.Rachel: Yes!!Chandler: All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)Ross: (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?Chandler: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.Phoebe: Yeesh, what’d you do about it?Chandler: Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.Monica: I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.Joey: Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)(Ross throws his hands out in a “What are you doing?” gesture)Rachel: Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.Chandler: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em.Monica: Okay, can we please go eat?Joey: Yeah. What are we getting?Monica: (to Chandler) Anything but stew.Ross: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.Joey: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?Chandler: (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?(Monica, Ross, Chandler, and Joey exit.)Phoebe: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?Rachel: Yeah.Phoebe: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?Rachel: Oh, ah with who?Phoebe: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?Phoebe: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...Rachel: Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.Phoebe: Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)[Scene: A Gym, Pete is training for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, with his trainer, Hoshi.]Hoshi: You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?Pete: I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?Hoshi: It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!Monica: (entering) Hi!Pete: Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.Hoshi: All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)Monica: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.Pete: Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be a house painter.Monica: Promise me you’ll be careful.Pete: I promise.Monica: Hey, are we still on for tonight?Pete: Yeah.Monica: Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...Hoshi: No! No boom-boom before big fight!Monica: How ‘bout just a boom?[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there with Bonnie, as Rachel enters.]Rachel: (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?Phoebe: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)Bonnie: Hi!Rachel: This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re Bonnie?Bonnie: I can show you an ID if you want?Rachel: Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.Bonnie: Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.Rachel: Oh, that must be it.Phoebe: (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.Bonnie: Thanks! You too.(Phoebe starts to leave, Rachel slowly follows, shocked about how good Bonnie looks now.)[cut to outside of Central Perk]Rachel: (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.Phoebe: Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.Rachel: How could you not tell me that she has hair?Phoebe: I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.Rachel: (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!Phoebe: Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.Rachel: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!Phoebe: Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.Rachel: Why, does she have a bad personality?Phoebe: Oh no, Bonnie’s the best![Scene: Chandler’s office, Chandler is bent over getting some water as his boss approaches.]Doug: Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of Chandler’s co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)Chandler: (to his co-workers) What is with him?Phil: With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy!Stevens: We never get smacked.Chandler: Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.Phil: Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.Stevens: I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.Doug: (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?Chandler: No sir.Doug: There you go. (smacks him on the butt)[Scene: The Ultimate Fighting Championship, Ross and Monica are there watching Pete.]Ross: (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!Monica: God Ross, what is that?Ross: Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!Announcer: From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!![Pete enters with his entourage all pumped up, and Ross and Monica are the only ones who stand up and cheer.]Monica: I love you, Pete!!!Announcer: And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!(The crowd goes wild, and Ross is the only one boo-ing him.)Monica: (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!Pete: Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.Ross: Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.(Pete and Monica kiss, and Monica mouths “I love you.” to him.)Ross: All right! You go get him! Let’s go!Referee: Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, “Yes.”) Let’s get it on!!(They both rush each other. Tank picks Pete up and carries him over and slams him into the fence surrounding the ring.)Pete: Uh-oh.(Tank carries Pete over to the other side of the ring, and we see both Ross and Monica wince in pain.)Commercial Break[Scene: The Arena, after the fight. Monica is walking up to a defeated Pete.]Monica: Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.Pete: It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”Monica: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.Pete: What, look back?Monica: Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?Pete: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?Monica: Well, no. But...Pete: Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.Monica: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!Pete: Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.Monica: You didn’t know that already?Pete: Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.Monica: Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.Pete: Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.Monica: Yeah. That-that was the problem.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's balcony, Ross and Phoebe are grilling some burgers and hot dogs.]Monica: (joining them) Hey.Ross: Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?Monica: Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.Ross: Hot dog?Monica: Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)Phoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?Ross: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.Phoebe: Ohh, that’s too bad!Ross: No, I-I’m saying I liked her.Phoebe: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.Ross: Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.Phoebe: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?Chandler: (joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?Ross: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.Joey: (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!Ross: Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?Chandler: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.Joey: (sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!(Chandler, Ross, and Phoebe all stop dead in their tracks at the news.)[Scene: Chandler’s office, Chandler is confronting his boss about the butt smacking thing. His boss is writing on a white board.]Chandler: Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!Doug: (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?Chandler: No, I ah, I didn’t do them.Doug: Oh, you forgot?Chandler: No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.Doug: Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!Chandler: Doug!!Doug: Hmm.Chandler: I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.Doug: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!Chandler: No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.Doug: Oh?Chandler: Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.Doug: Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.Chandler: Okay. (he starts to leave)Doug: Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out) Ahhhhhhh!Chandler: Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)[Scene: The street outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are talking and walking.]Phoebe: Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?Rachel: (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.(We see Ross and Bonnie laughing and having a good time.)Phoebe: No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!Rachel: Phoebe! (goes back to the window)Phoebe: (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.Rachel: Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...Phoebe: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.Rachel: Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.Phoebe: You said it was okay!Rachel: You said she was bald!!Phoebe: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!Rachel: Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!Phoebe: Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?Rachel: (quietly) Yes.Phoebe: Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?Rachel: Yes.Phoebe: So?Rachel: I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)Phoebe: (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.Rachel: What?Phoebe: Oh, we killed them all.Rachel: Oh!(They both jump up and wipe off their butts.)[Scene: A locker room, Pete is in a full upper-body cast. Monica enters, sees him, and gasps. Pete tries to turn around, and winces in pain.]Pete: It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.Monica: Please tell me you’re stopping now.Pete: I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. (stands up and starts swinging his arms) See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror.Monica: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!Pete: I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.Monica: Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!Pete: Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.Monica: Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.Pete: Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.Monica: Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)Pete: Mon-Monica?Monica: Yes?Pete: Could you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)[Scene: Chandler’s office, he is just finishing up a meeting with his boss and the rest of his team.]Doug: So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. (They start to leave) Phil! Nice job. (smacks him on the butt) Stevens! Way to go! (smacks him on the butt) Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! (smacks him on the butt) (Chandler walks up) Bing! Good job, couldn’t have done it without ya. (he shakes his hand)Chandler: Thank you, sir.Stevens: (coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.Doug: Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?Chandler: No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.Doug: Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?Chandler: Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!Doug: Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)Closing Credits[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is watching Pete fight on TV. Monica is hiding in the kitchen, not watching.]TV Announcer: Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...Chandler: Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!Rachel: Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)Joey: Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!Monica: Really?!Joey: No-o-o!!TV Announcer: Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.All: Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)Phoebe: Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?Ross: Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.All: Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)[Scene: Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe is there. Bonnie is telling them of her sex-capades.]Chandler: (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!Bonnie: All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.Chandler: Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.[cut to Rachel and Monica at the counter.]Rachel: (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?Joey: Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.Monica: Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.Joey: Well, I think we all learned something.Phoebe: (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.Chandler: (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.Phoebe: Y'know what that means?Joey: That you’re actually 50?Phoebe: No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.All: Oh!Rachel: That is so cool.Phoebe: I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?All: Yeah! Yeah, we can!Bonnie: (to Ross) Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work!Ross: That’s too bad.Rachel: (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.Phoebe: So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.Joey: Hey, Bonnie had sex there!(Rachel turns and gives him a look, and Joey quickly apologises.)Opening Credits[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are waiting for Phoebe to arrive with the cab.]Monica: (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.Chandler: You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.Monica: (sarcastic) Thanks!Chandler: Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.(At that suggestion Monica starts laughing.)Monica: Yeah right.Chandler: Why is that so funny?Monica: You made a joke right? So I laughed.Chandler: Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?Monica: Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)Chandler: Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like (in a fake voice) “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”Monica: Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.Joey: (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!Monica: Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!Joey: No, it’s just my luggage.(Phoebe drives up.)Chandler, Monica, and Joey: Hey!!Joey: Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!Phoebe: Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.Ross: Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?Phoebe: Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.Rachel: (approaching) Hey!Chandler: Hey!Joey: Hey-hey, check out the hat!(She is wearing this giant straw hat, the brim on it must be at least, least foot wide.)Chandler: What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!Monica: Seriously, where did you get the hat?Rachel: Ross gave it to me.Ross: Yeah, I think she looks good.Rachel: Ohh, thank you.Chandler: Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?Rachel: Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.Phoebe: And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.[Scene: At the Beach, it’s raining cats and dogs as the gang arrives. Chandler and Monica are taking shelter under Rachel’s hat.]Ross: Go, go, go!Rachel: Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!(They get inside and notice on small problem.)Phoebe: Oy!!Monica: What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the floor, which is covered in sand)Phoebe: Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.Ross: Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.[Scene: Phoebe Sr. house, she is a real estate agent and is trying to sell a house over the phone. By the way, it’s still raining outside.]Phoebe Sr: Well, yes, it’s kind’ve an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.Phoebe: (at the door) Knock, knock, knock.Phoebe Sr: (on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in. (on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)Phoebe: (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?Phoebe Sr: Ahh, yes.Phoebe: Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!Phoebe Sr: You’re Erwin’s daughter?!Phoebe: No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here.

I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy.Phoebe Sr: Take it easy--if you want, there’s cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!Phoebe: No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.Phoebe Sr: Oh.Phoebe: (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?Phoebe Sr: Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.Phoebe: (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.Phoebe Sr: Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.Phoebe: Oh, what? What was it?Phoebe Sr: The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.Phoebe: (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.[Scene: The beach house, it’s still raining. Chandler is building a sand castle, Rachel is doing Monica’s nails, and they’re all drinking margaritas, obviously bored.]Joey: (getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?Monica: What?!Joey: I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.All: No, no!Monica: What are you crazy?!Joey: Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!Rachel: (to Monica) Allll done!Monica: Aww, thank you.Rachel: Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when she comes to Ross.)Ross: No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a “Please?” look.) No way!Rachel: Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.(Ross shoots Joey a look, who shoots Chandler a look, who gives Joey an “Oh my God.” look back.)Ross: Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend...

Oh, no-no-no!(They get into a wrestling match, that ends with Ross making Rachel paint her forehead with the nail polish. They both end up lying next to each other, stop, and look at each other for a moment.)Phoebe: (entering) Oh, hey!Chandler: Hey!Ross: Hey!Phoebe: Oh, so, how are we doing?Chandler: Bored and bored!Joey: Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?All: Noo!!Monica: (to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?Phoebe: I’m kind, caring, and sweet.

They both look at each other for a moment, and then embrace in a more passionate kiss, only to be interrupted by Joey and Chandler coming outside.)Chandler: (to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care!

She gets halfway in and the window slams shut on her butt.)Phoebe: Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!(She starts walking across the darkened room and hits her head on a wind chime hanging from the ceiling, to stop it from making a noise she grabs it and “Shhh’s” it. She goes into the kitchen and finds Phoebe Sr.’s appointment book, to read it she opens the freezer. Just as she starts to read, Phoebe Sr. jumps out from her bedroom with a coat hanger, startling Phoebe.)Phoebe: No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!Phoebe Sr: Then don't break in!!Phoebe: I’m sorry.Phoebe Sr: What are you doing here?!Phoebe: I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.Phoebe Sr: What?!Phoebe: Umm, okay, okay, look.
